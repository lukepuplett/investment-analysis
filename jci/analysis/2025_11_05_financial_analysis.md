4. **Goodwill:** $16.7B goodwill represents 39% of assets - potential impairment risk if businesses underperform
5. **Portfolio Review:** Strategic review ongoing - potential divestitures could impact financials

### Mitigating Factors
1. **Strong Cash Generation:** >100% FCF conversion provides liquidity buffer
2. **Investment Grade Rating:** BBB+/Baa1 maintains access to capital markets
3. **Record Backlog:** $14.6B provides revenue visibility and working capital support
4. **Operational Improvements:** Lean initiatives reducing working capital needs
