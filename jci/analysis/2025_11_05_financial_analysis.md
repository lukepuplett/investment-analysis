# Johnson Controls International (JCI) – Financial Analysis

**Date:** November 5, 2025  
**Analyst:** Investment Analysis Repository

## Executive Summary

**BLUF: Johnson Controls demonstrates improving financial health with strong cash generation ($2.87B TTM free cash flow), record $14.6B backlog providing visibility, and accelerating margin expansion (17.6% segment EBITA margin, up 20 bps). However, the company faces challenges including negative working capital (-$776M), high leverage (68% debt/equity), and China exposure risk. The recent appointment of new CEO Joakim Weidemanis brings operational transformation potential through lean business system implementation. **Recommendation: Cautiously optimistic** - Strong execution track record and transformation initiatives support upside, but portfolio review and margin gap to peers warrant monitoring.**

## Financial Risk Assessment

### Key Risk Factors
1. **Working Capital:** Negative working capital of -$776M creates liquidity risk
2. **Leverage:** Net debt/EBITDA at 2.5x is manageable but requires consistent cash generation
3. **China Exposure:** APAC orders down 8% due to China softness, representing ~13% of revenue
4. **Goodwill:** $16.7B goodwill represents 39% of assets - potential impairment risk if businesses underperform
5. **Portfolio Review:** Strategic review ongoing - potential divestitures could impact financials

### Mitigating Factors
1. **Strong Cash Generation:** >100% FCF conversion provides liquidity buffer
2. **Investment Grade Rating:** BBB+/Baa1 maintains access to capital markets
3. **Record Backlog:** $14.6B provides revenue visibility and working capital support
4. **Operational Improvements:** Lean initiatives reducing working capital needs
5. **Fixed Rate Debt:** 85% fixed rate protects against interest rate volatility

## Outlook and Forecast

### Guidance Summary
- **FY2025 Revenue:** Mid-single-digit organic growth (reaffirmed)
- **FY2025 Margin:** ~90 bps adjusted segment EBITA margin expansion (reaffirmed)
- **FY2025 EPS:** $3.65-$3.68, up 14-15% (raised from ~$3.60)
- **FY2025 FCF Conversion:** >100% (raised from ~100%)

## Conclusion

Johnson Controls demonstrates improving financial health with strong cash generation, accelerating margin expansion, and record backlog providing visibility. The company's focus on operational improvement through lean initiatives and portfolio optimization supports continued margin expansion. However, negative working capital, high leverage, and China exposure require monitoring. The new CEO's transformation initiatives show early promise but will take time to scale. Financial position is solid with investment-grade credit rating and disciplined capital allocation.

**Key Strengths:**
- Strong free cash flow generation (>100% conversion)
- Record backlog ($14.6B) providing visibility
- Accelerating margin expansion (17.6% segment EBITA)
- Investment-grade credit rating
- Disciplined capital allocation

**Key Concerns:**
- Negative working capital (-$776M)
- High leverage (68% debt/equity)
- China exposure risk
- Significant goodwill balance
- Margin gap to industry leaders

**Investment Thesis Support:** Financial metrics support a cautiously optimistic view. Strong execution and transformation initiatives provide upside potential, but portfolio review and operational improvements need time to materialize.
