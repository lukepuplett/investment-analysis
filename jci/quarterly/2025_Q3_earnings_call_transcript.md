**Operator:** Hello everyone and welcome to the Johnson Controls Q3 2025 earnings conference call. My name is Nadia and I'll be coordinating the call today. If you would like to ask a question at the end of the presentation, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. I will now hand the call over to Jim Lucas, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin. Jim, please go ahead.

**Jim Lucas (VP of Investor Relations):** Good morning and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss Johnson Controls' fiscal 3rd quarter 2025 results. Joining me on the call today are Johnson Controls' Chief Executive Officer, Joakim Weidemanis, and Marc Vandiepenbeeck, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, let me remind you that during our presentation today, we will make forward-looking statements that reflect our current views about our future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for a list of these important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. We will also reference certain non-GAAP measures throughout today's presentation.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are contained in the schedules attached to our press release and in the appendix to this presentation, both of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of Johnson Controls' website. I will now turn the call over to Joakim.

**Joakim Weidemanis (CEO):** Thanks, Jim, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. This morning, we announced strong 3rd quarter results, continuing the momentum we've sustained throughout the year. Organic sales grew 6%. Segment margins expanded 20 basis points to 17.6%, and adjusted EPS grew 11% and exceeded our guidance. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow has nearly doubled to $1.8 billion, and we are on track to deliver over 100% free cash flow conversion for the year. Orders grew 2%, led by strength in the Americas and offset by ongoing softness in China. Our backlog grew 11% to $14.6 billion and remains at record levels. We continue to see strength in demand for both our systems and service solutions. We are now building an even stronger foundation for long-term success by developing a business system focused on simplifying operations, accelerating growth, and scaling our impact.

This includes sharpening our focus on what matters most to customers and deploying lean principles to tackle barriers to growth. We're raising our full-year guidance, and Marc will give more details later in the call. I now have my 1st quarter under my belt, and tomorrow is my 140th day at a company celebrating 140 years of leadership. That is 140 years of winning with customers, driving innovation, and supporting the advancement of human society with solutions for smart, productive, safe, and sustainable buildings. After all, the advancement of science, education, healthcare, and manufacturing occur in buildings. As we celebrate and reflect upon our history, we believe our best days are still ahead of us. Unlocking our potential depends on placing even greater emphasis on the customer. Our goal is to deliver consistent, predictable results over time and outperform our competition, enabling strong capital allocation and enhancing value for shareholders.

Since joining Johnson Controls, I've had the opportunity to travel the globe, visiting our largest factories and spending time in the field with our customers and teams. I have visited well over 100 customers, all of our major innovation centers, and walked more than 30 plants. I met with hundreds of our frontline colleagues in sales, service, R&D, and manufacturing. These travels produced insights that will inform our future success as a company. First, we need to sharpen our focus on our customers while also staying ahead of the competition. Customer centricity will fuel accelerated growth by enabling us to win and retain customers more effectively through differentiated offerings and how we serve them. Second, it's essential that we enhance our investment in R&D to accelerate innovation. Our IP portfolio is strong, with 8,200 patents and more on the way.

Our products and solutions deliver results that resonate with our customers. While we possess considerable strengths, there remain opportunities to accelerate growth within our core domains by addressing gaps in our product portfolio. Third, our field position of 40,000 frontline colleagues has been and continues to be a competitive advantage. We see clear opportunities to better equip and support them, making it easier for them to deliver for our customers. By doing so, we can get more leverage from our team and expand capacity and productivity to drive stronger results. Given the importance of this effort, we recently appointed Chris Scalia as Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer. Chris brings a unique combination of people and culture strategy, operational excellence, and a deep commitment to building high-performing teams.

We're excited for Chris to hit the ground running as we continue to transform Johnson Controls into a growth-focused, customer-centric powerhouse and a magnet for talent. As we look ahead to our ongoing transformation, developing a business system and embedding it in our cultural foundation is a critical step in driving long-term success, one that requires dedicated effort, discipline, and patience. My deep experience with proven business systems, combined with spending meaningful time at Gemba, has helped us shape a clear vision for what this could look like at Johnson Controls. This business system is how we will win and run the company. It will be anchored in proven methodologies like 80/20 and lean and augmented by digitization and AI. First, 80/20 is a powerful operating model that sharpens our focus, cutting through complexity so we can concentrate our energy on what matters most to our customers. We simplify.

Adopting principles of lean, we convert this focus into action with a strong orientation on what matters most to our customers. We eliminate waste, streamline workflows, and accelerate processes to drive speed and efficiency across the organization to better serve customers and increase our competitiveness. We accelerate. Throughout the process, we embed digitization and AI as core enablers in our process improvement. This augments our focus and speed with smarter systems and the ability to scale impact for our customers and our people. We scale. Simplify. Accelerate, scale. While we've made progress over the last several quarters, we know that with a strong business system in place, we can accelerate and improve our results over time. We will solve customer problems faster and more effectively by empowering our people. It will become our way of life at Johnson Controls. Our efforts are already underway.

Since the last earnings call, we have identified a number of growth blockers, and we are actively addressing them. In general, the growth blockers center around the speed of execution and more effectively and efficiently leveraging our existing capabilities in the field and beyond. To ensure speed in decision-making and implementation, it is important to identify the root cause of these growth blockers and develop countermeasures that we can then implement into consistent, repeatable processes. We have started with a narrow focus to deliver results quickly, and then we will scale more broadly. I can give you two early examples of progress. The first example is in our conventional HVAC business, where we're creating value for our customers and our frontline colleagues who serve them.

Our objective is to substantially increase the amount of time our sales teams can dedicate to engaging with customers by streamlining internal processes and eliminating waste that does not contribute direct value to the customer experience. Over the last four weeks, this team has identified specific countermeasures to double time with customers for our sellers. This will unlock opportunities to better leverage our enviable field position. Another focus area is improving lead times for our key chillers in North America, where we continue to see dynamic growth in the fast-expanding data center vertical. We have an opportunity to cut lead times in half, which will both improve our competitiveness and create additional manufacturing capacity. As we deliver substantial improvements around the growth blockers we have identified, we can replicate these successes and deploy across our global portfolio.

With momentum building, our executive team has been trained on the core foundations of our future business system, and each of them has participated in at least one Kaizen. After countless Kaizens throughout my career, I participated in my first Johnson Controls Kaizen a couple of weeks ago. Over the next few months, we will train our top 200 leaders and ensure their participation in Kaizens and our program overall. As we begin to see tangible results from these early initiatives, we will expand engagement and training across the organization. While we have many opportunities to drive growth through operational improvement and ultimately more consistent, predictable results, we're also continuously evaluating and refining our strategy. This has started with a fresh, objective view of all our business lines and solutions.

Looking ahead, we will evaluate our portfolio and make strategic decisions to ensure sustainable growth through targeted acquisitions or thoughtful exits. As we move forward, our focus will progress to a comprehensive review of our operations, including our manufacturing and back-office networks, to further unlock productivity and capacity. In summary, we believe there are clear opportunities to optimize our portfolio, footprint, cost structure, and the way we work going forward. This is an ongoing process with continued focus on delivering shareholder value. It has been a productive four months since I started at Johnson Controls. My excitement continues to build as we become more intensely focused on the customer, the people on the frontlines who serve them every day, and drive adoption of our future business system. I look forward to the journey ahead as we work together to deliver even greater value for our customers, team members, and shareholders.

With that, I will now turn it over to Marc.

**Marc Vandiepenbeeck (CFO):** Thanks, Joakim. Good morning, everyone. Turning to slide six, we deliver strong results in the fiscal 3rd quarter. While the broader environment remains uncertain, our execution continues to drive meaningful results. Our focus on operational efficiency is helping us to deliver for our customers and reinforce our competitive edge. Our team is committed to generating consistent, long-term value for our shareholders. In the quarter, organic revenue grew 6%, and segment margin expanded 20 basis points to 17.6% as we proactively mitigated the impact of tariffs through strategic sourcing and cost management initiatives. Adjusted EPS of $1.05 was up 11% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of our guidance range. On the balance sheet, we ended the 3rd quarter with approximately $700 million in available cash. Compared to last year, net debt declined to 2.5 times, which is within our long-term target range of 2-2.5 times.

Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow improved approximately $900 million year-over-year to $1.8 billion. The strong performance, driven by improved cash conversion, reflects our disciplined financial management and consistent operational execution. Let's now discuss our segment results in more detail on slides seven and eight. Orders in the quarter grew 2% as growth in the Americas was muted by softness in China. Customer engagement remains strong, and we continue to see healthy activity across our pipeline. Additionally, the mix of orders is shifting toward higher-margin solutions, reinforcing our long-term growth and profitability outlook. Geographically, orders in the Americas increased 5%, with mid-single-digit growth in systems. In EMEA, orders were up 2% against a tough comp with 6% growth in service, offsetting a 1% decline in systems. In APAC, orders were down 8% as a decline in systems more than offset double-digit growth in service.

At an enterprise level, organic sales growth was led by solid mid-single-digit growth in both systems and service. Sales in the Americas were up 7% organically, with continued strength in both HVAC and controls. In EMEA, organic sales grew 4%, led by 8% growth in service. In APAC, sales grew 6% organically, with strong double-digit growth from our resilient service business. We continue to maintain healthy margins through disciplined cost management and strategic pricing, ensuring profitability even in a dynamic market environment. Operationally, we have driven greater efficiency across our core processes, while improvements in our service mix have allowed us to prioritize higher-value offerings that enhance customer satisfaction and support long-term profitable growth. By region, EMEA adjusted segment EBITDA margin expanded 100 basis points to 14.1%, driven by improved productivity and a positive mix of service growth.

In APAC, adjusted margins expanded 70 basis points to 19.4% as productivity continued to improve. In Americas, adjusted margin improved 10 basis points to 18.5% as system growth outpaced service growth. Our backlog remains at record levels, growing 11% to $14.6 billion. System backlog grew 11%, and service backlog grew 8%. Let's now discuss our fiscal fourth quarter and full-year guidance on slide nine. As we enter the fourth quarter, we are building on strong momentum driven by enhanced operational efficiencies and a backlog that remains at historical high levels. We anticipate organic sales growth of low single digits, adjusted segment EBITDA margin of approximately 18.6%, and adjusted EPS in the range of $1.14-$1.17. As a reminder, we have a challenging comparison due to a large one-time project we successfully executed last year.

Based on strong execution and consistent performance, we are reaffirming our full-year guidance for mid-single-digit organic sales growth and approximately 90 basis points of adjusted segment EBITDA margin expansion. Additionally, we are raising our outlook for adjusted EPS and free cash flow conversion. We now expect adjusted EPS in the range of $3.65-$3.68 per share, representing 14%-15% growth. Building on our strengthened working capital position, year-to-date free cash flow performance reflects solid execution and financial discipline. As a result, we now anticipate achieving free cash flow conversion of greater than 100% for the full year. We continue to target returning 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we expect the sale of our residential and light commercial HVAC business to Bosch to close in our fiscal 4th quarter.

While we anticipate returning the majority of the net proceeds to our shareholders through share repurchases, the impact on this year's share count is expected to be minimal, with the benefits primarily accruing in the next fiscal year. Operator, we are now ready for questions.

**Operator:** We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to remove your question, please press star followed by two. When we're preparing to ask your question, please ensure your phone is muted locally. We ask you please limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up. The first question goes to Amit Mehrotra of UBS. Amit, please go ahead.

**Amit Mehrotra (Managing Director and Industrial Sector Head):** Thanks. Good morning. Joakim, I guess as you approach five months on the job, I know that's not a lot of time or a long time, but I guess it would just be helpful nonetheless to understand your initial observations. What are some of the KPIs you're focused on to kind of make sure the global organization is moving in the right direction? And importantly, how quickly you think we can see some of the tangible progress on the return profile of the business?

**Joakim Weidemanis (CEO):** Yeah. Good morning, Amit. I hope you're doing well. Four months in, as you heard here in the prepared commentary, I visited a lot of places around the world, more than 100 customers, walked more than 30 plants, and sat with colleagues in all of our innovation centers. I think I've gotten a really good grasp of the opportunity here. As you've heard me talk about before, number one is we need to sharpen our focus on the customer at every level and every function of our company. That's such a foundational point. I'll come back to that. I also see opportunities to continue to drive growth through innovation, through increased investments in R&D. I'll come back to how we're going to fund that. I see that we have really this enviable field position, 40,000 colleagues in the field, a capability that's been built over decades, difficult to replicate.

We have to find ways to unlock faster improvement in the company, that improvement that is valued by customers and gives us room to continue to invest in, for example, innovation. That's why I spoke about a new business system that is in formation, that we have started to deploy. You heard a little bit about on the prepared remarks that that is anchored in 80/20 simplification and lean, which is about acceleration, speed in many ways as the ultimate competitive advantage, and augmented by digitization and AI to scale. Simplify, accelerate, and scale. The notion here is that speed is one of the largest competitive advantages. You can't go too broad too quickly because you also want to get the buy-in from your organization while you deliver value early. We've started already, and we're going deep.

As you heard, I gave two examples, one commercial example, which is more growth-oriented, and one operational example, which is both cost and growth-oriented. The commercial example, and these examples are examples, capabilities that we're building that we're going to deploy much broader over time. You want to start narrow so you can really understand the root causes of why we're not able to perform better and so that you can go after the countermeasures and then build new processes and capabilities and then inspire other people in other parts of the company to do the same. The two examples were in our HVAC conventional business in North America and one part of the country.

We have a team working on, and they're fourth Kaizen now, actually, where we have a path to basically doubling the selling time that our sellers have in that part of the business by removing waste from processes and improving the processes that we have. I'm very excited about the potential of that more broadly over time. On the operation side, I gave you an example of where we're working on cutting the lead time in half. We're in our third Kaizen on that one. I was in one of those Kaizens myself, actually, the other week. Cutting lead time in half is what you do to achieve that. It is basically the same things, similar things you would do to reduce cost and capital tied up, working capital, that is. That effort will generate efforts beyond reducing the lead time.

Of course, reducing the lead time makes us more competitive. In that case, the product lines we've started with are oriented towards the data center market, where demand is still very high, and being able to deliver faster than others is an important part of our competitive advantage. Anyway, we're starting narrow, exciting the organization, training the organization, and then we're going to deploy this more widely over time. We have lots of opportunities here on these kinds of themes. I'm very excited about that.

**Operator:** Thank you. Moving on to the next question from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Scott, please go ahead.

**Scott Davis (Chairman, CEO, and Lead Research Analyst):** Hey, good morning, guys.

**Joakim Weidemanis (CEO):** Morning, Scott.

**Scott Davis (Chairman, CEO, and Lead Research Analyst):** Appreciate the color on that question. I'm kind of going to go a slightly different direction. You've had 140 days. Maybe that's not enough time to answer this, perhaps. Do you have a better sense, Joakim, now of how you can accelerate growth in fire and security and how that business really, how HVAC and fire and security can really lever off of each other? I think historically, it's always been a question mark of whether they fit or not. I think investors at this point are pretty open-minded on hearing your view.

**Joakim Weidemanis (CEO):** Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for that question, Scott. Yeah. These are, as we spoke about last time. With all of you, I mean, I see these are fundamentally different businesses serving a similar customer base, but different personas at different points in time. We are calling it as it is. That does not mean that they are not businesses that do not have potential. They have potential as well. Many of the examples I gave on the new business system here are focused on HVAC and controls because we think that those markets inherently have higher levels of growth, but there is growth in fire and security as well. The approaches that I described, we are gradually going to deploy into those businesses, and we think there is good potential to improve the performance there as well over time. Like I said, we are taking a dispassionate view of the portfolio.

We are two-plus months into a deeper strategic review of our businesses, where we are at today and looking at the future and who we would like to be. The board, of course, I am working very closely with the board. Obviously, these are not things you conclude in sort of one cycle, one board meeting. Over the next couple of months, together with the board, we are going to start to draw conclusions on what the portfolio will look like here going forward.

**Operator:** Thank you. The next question goes to Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Jeff, please go ahead.

**Jeff Sprague (Founder and Managing Partner):** Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Wondering if we could shift to free cash flow. Marc, nice to see the bump here this morning. Maybe could you address, and certainly, Joakim, your thoughts on this also, but where the most significant opportunities are on the free cash flow side. Should we view this 100% plus sort of a catch-up on low-hanging fruit, or is your confidence level that the company can kind of consistently be in that 100% zip code rising here?

**Marc Vandiepenbeeck (CFO):** For sure. Jeff, thanks for the comments. We had a strong start of the year in cash flow, and we've continued that momentum. I think the progress we've made this year has a lot to do with our accounts receivable, our collection management, and everything goes from managing order and managing customer through that experience. That has allowed us to really continuously improve the conversion throughout the year. That allowed us to get to that 100+% conversion. Almost $1 billion of improvement year-on-year is a good feat, but it does not mean that we are done and that is all of the benefit we are going to see. We still have those fundamental structural headwinds we have talked about, of our effective tax rate being slightly different than the cash tax rate, and we still have slightly elevated CapEx.

Those two things over time will die down. There are a lot of opportunities that are going to come from our lean efforts and lean transformation. I think if you think about when we start that flywheel around that lean transformation, the need for facilities will reduce over time, which will reduce CapEx, which will reduce inventory. Our ability to increase cycle time and improve customer centricity will also drive ultimately better outputs from an inventory standpoint. We think that is where moving forward the larger opportunity is. There is still progress to be made on every aspect of the fundamental of our free cash flow conversion.

**Joakim Weidemanis (CEO):** Yeah. I mean, I'll second that. The lead time reduction example I gave, I mean, in principle, that means that we'll be able to get a lot more output from that facility without adding additional physical asset space. That means that we're going to sort of decouple versus historical trends, the CapEx that we need for our growth. That's really what that is about. We're also going to, by the same token, because with the approaches we're applying there, decouple the addition of inventory dollars for the growth dollars that we have. That's really what that lead time reduction initiative is about. Like I said, we've started narrow and we'll go broader over time. On the commercial side as well, we have a workstream.

I think we're in our second Kaizen now, where we're looking at how we're performing on billing and how fast do we bill, how accurate is our billing, and therefore what is sort of the first pass yield on customers paying invoices. No company in this world is perfect on invoicing, right? Sometimes you miss a few. If you have a couple of percent of invoicing errors that you need to redo versus less than 1%, that not only impacts customer satisfaction, but of course, also your cash flow. We've seen some good opportunities in that area too. Those themes give me confidence that we're going to be able to maintain the cash conversion that we've seen so far this year.

[Additional Q&A continues with analysts from various firms including Nigel Coe, Steve Toussaint, Joe Ritchie, Nicole DeBlaise, Joe O'Dea, Andrew Obin, Chris Snyder, Julian Mitchell, Andy Kaplowitz, and Deanne Dre covering topics such as portfolio strategy, free cash flow sustainability, margin expansion opportunities, data center growth, service business margins, and operating leverage.]

**Operator:** This concludes our Q&A session. I will now hand the call back over to Joakim Weidemanis for any closing comments.
