### Annual Contract Value (ACV)

ACV is an estimate of the annual value of our portfolio of term license and software maintenance and support (SMS) contracts, the annual value of SMS agreements purchased with perpetual licenses and the annual value of standalone SMS agreements purchased with certain legacy AspenTech term license agreements. Because software revenue recognition rules require upfront recognition of a significant portion of agreements, comparisons of revenue across periods is primarily impacted by the timing of term license renewals. ACV approximates the estimated annual billings associated with our recurring term license and SMS agreements at a point in time, and management finds this business metric useful in evaluating the growth and performance of our industrial software business.

For agreements denominated in other currencies, a fixed historical rate is used to calculate ACV in U.S. dollars in order to eliminate the impact of currency fluctuations.
