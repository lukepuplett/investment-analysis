## Question & Answer Session

### Jeffrey Sprague, Vertical Research Partners

**Q: Could we touch on the margins again and Intelligent Devices in particular? Dollar sales were actually up in the quarter sequentially and dollar profits were down sequentially. Could we unpack that?**

**A (Mike Baughman):** Intelligent Devices adjusted EBITDA margin was 24.4%, down about 1.1 points. There was a meaningful impact of tariffs, which we expected, but there was also a meaningful impact with FX included in there that really wasn't expected that drove that down. When you take those two out, it's up 20 basis points. The tariffs largely hit that group. There isn't nearly as much tariffs in Control Systems and Software. So that's where you see all of that tariff math reading through for the most part. The unexpected piece was the FX, which is FX to be clear of balance sheet exposures that then get mark to market and that is in the segment EBITDA margins.

**Q: On Test and Measurement, the inflection that you're seeing there, how would you characterize vertical markets that might be driving that?**

**A (Lal Karsanbhai):** We saw a very broad-based recovery across all segments and all world areas in Test and Measurement. The encouraging segment recovery portfolio business, which is the vast array of thousands of customers with a diversified end market basis, gives us the best indication of the recovery in the market. In addition to that, aerospace defense continued to remain strong as it has been for a number of quarters now. But the recovery in semiconductor and of course, easy comparisons in automotive made it possible to have a positive order number across all four of the segments.

**A (Ram Krishnan):** From world area or region of the world perspective, Asia being the strongest, they went down first. So they're recovering, rebounding very strong. China has been actually very good in terms of recovery as well, followed by North America and then Europe. So every segment and every world area is strongly positive.

### Steve Tusa, JPMorgan

**Q: Can you talk about how you saw the quarter play out? I think you guys said the orders in April were up seven percent and you may have exited at a bit of a lower rate.**

**A (Lal Karsanbhai):** We felt strongly about the mid-single digit exit rate that we talked about at the beginning of the quarter. And there were some puts and takes as we went through in terms of timing speed, which we always have on some of the orders. You can see some of it slipped into July, some of it might have been pulled forward for some just large capital bookings. What remained very consistent throughout the quarter was our MRO bookings. There was really no fluctuation there, and that gave us a really good basis. And then we had the capital fluctuations come in and out just based on timing.

**Q: As we move into next year from a software perspective, is anything next year with regards to the comps at Aspen or anything like that from a growth perspective that we should keep in mind?**

**A (Ram Krishnan):** From an Aspen perspective, ACV continues in terms of high single digit growth into double digits as some of the synergies come through. So nothing in terms of ACV from an Aspen perspective that is concerning. And then certainly as it relates to our other businesses, the Process segment will remain pretty consistent at mid-single digits with recovering discrete.

### Andy Kaplowitz, Citi

**Q: A little bit more on your core process and hybrid markets. If you look at the business or the end markets, you expect stability or maybe slight improvement moving forward. How do you get that? Is it all from power and LNG?**

**A (Lal Karsanbhai):** LNG, power generation and life sciences will continue to fuel process hybrid on a forward basis here, given the visibility we currently have. Chemical is a mixed story. We actually are doing quite well in specialty chemicals. The bulk chemical story is negatively impacted in Europe and in China. And we just have a demand condition and an overcapacity condition that impacts those end markets. But just about as I look forward into 2026, certainly, I expect the momentum to continue as capacity is invested, not just to meet the energy security needs, but also to nationalize, localize manufacturing of drugs and of course the enormous expansion we have in generation and transmission distribution capacity.

**Q: Back to Test and Measurement. How much of the improvement is the markets versus your own self-help?**

**A (Lal Karsanbhai):** So much work has been done by this team led by Ram and Ritu Fabre and they've done an exceptional job resetting this company to address and to be a quick, more nimble respondent to market opportunities. So certainly, have seen market recovery, underlying market recovery, which fuels, but we believe that we're outperforming the market. And that is based on not just the reset of the commercial focus in the company, but also in the new products that we're bringing to market. And the example I highlighted with LabVIEW is a new generation, new incremental product in the marketplace.

**A (Ram Krishnan):** The focus on new products, LabVIEW, the software suite, they're launching a new DAC or a data acquisition product, which is a core capability that NI and NI customers were expecting. Also on the commercial side, going back to the basics as it relates to country specific growth plans, they have great exposure in many, many parts of the world. And going back to the basics and developing go to market plans and growth initiatives. Simple things, but hugely important as the market recovers, where our management system deployed is helping NI grow faster than the market.

### Scott Davis, Melius Research

**Q: Want to talk a little bit about Ovation. When you talk about orders up 40%, is this all new projects? Is it a mix of retrofit new projects?**

**A (Lal Karsanbhai):** There are a couple of categories there. There is new project new construction. I highlighted the Entergy combined cycle plans as an example. Those typically have long lead times. There are extension of life in plants that we're seeing that in combined cycle and coal and in nuclear in The United States and Asia. And then lastly, there are modernizations, where whether it's for cybersecurity purposes, AI purposes or other plans put in new control systems and upgrade their Ovation. All three of those are bookings, they all have different implications to the ship ratio given the time it takes to implement and build.

**A (Ram Krishnan):** Traditionally, the power industry for us has been one of competitive displacement. Greenfield opportunities have really picked up in the recent past. But what is certainly a net positive for us is the greenfield capacity investment and combined cycle happening in The U.S. to fuel the power needs for the data centers. But certainly markets like China as well, there's significant level of greenfield activity and we're capitalizing on that with the technology position we have in Ovation. So all three aspects of the business, greenfield, modernizations as well as continued MRO and competitive displacement is fueling the order growth, which will convert to sales over the next couple of years.

**Q: Are those installs profitable? Is it more of a loss leader and then you make money over time on the subscription?**

**A (Ram Krishnan):** We make money on the install. We make more money on the aftermarket. It's the standard formula we've described in the past. There's a margin delta between when we win the project, greenfield and modernization and then ongoing MRO is a very profitable revenue stream.

### Joe O'Dea, Wells Fargo

**Q: Can you talk through Control Systems and Software a little bit? We saw really good organic growth there last quarter, this quarter more in that kind of low mid-single digit range.**

**A (Mike Baughman):** Remember last quarter we talked about the Total deal pulling into Q2, which would have been in Q3 and Aspen's Emerson Q3 there Q4 was traditionally their biggest. So we have that movement. But underlying Aspen ACV growth and continued revenue growth very strong this year. And then the systems business continues to do very well in the mid-single digits and continues to see all the dynamics that Lal and Ram have talked about.

**A (Ram Krishnan):** Overall from a full year perspective, single digit growth plus in the systems and software business. But as Mike described, the lumpiness associated with how Aspen recognizes ASC 606 with project lumpiness and how we execute within systems and software will have variations from one quarter to the next. But overall, we feel very, very good about the high end of the 4% to 7% range for underlying growth in our systems and software business.

**Q: A little bit more color on the discrete side of the business and contrasting Test and Measurement with legacy discrete.**

**A (Lal Karsanbhai):** There are two very important dimensions of the legacy discrete, Joe, that differ from Test and Measurement. The first is exposure to automotive and packaging businesses, particularly in Western Europe and China. And both of those markets continue to be relatively depressed and challenging. And that certainly dampened the recovery there. Offset, of course, by some of the more traditional broad-based industrials, which have impacted positively, but generally speaking, a much more muted and slightly positive as they came out of the quarter, but significantly more muted than the broad-based applications and market exposures that the Test and Measurement business has.

**A (Ram Krishnan):** The outsized market exposure for us in Europe, which has been the slowest market to recover for our traditional discrete business, factory automation piece versus test and measurement points to the disparity in the pace and amplitude of recovery. But as Lal described, the automotive segment and then factory automation as it relates to Europe and China have more muted recovery than many of the markets in Test and Measurement.

### Andrew Obin, Bank of America

**Q: Just a broader question on your power vertical. What do you think is sustainable growth rate going forward? Can it stay elevated for the next 24 months?**

**A (Lal Karsanbhai):** I certainly believe it can based on the visibility we have of opportunity across both markets, generation and transmission distribution. And I think it's sustainable in the high teens kind of range over the next couple of years. As a matter of fact, we'll probably highlight this market and when we all get together in New York City in November as a growth factor for the company because the dollar spend that we're seeing and it's not just a U.S. Story, obviously, is very meaningful and impactful. It's been a significant shift for this team, which had been a high participation rate company to begin with, but essentially grew over the last twenty years by driving competitive displacement. And now we've refocused the team really around Project Pursuit and expansion of market. And so we see that momentum. We're very close to our customers because of that very large participation in the business. And we are very optimistic about the next twenty-four months at high rates of growth.

**A (Ram Krishnan):** Our customer intimacy in this business is very high. Bob Yeager, who runs this business, has great relationships with a lot of the major power companies here in The U.S. And certainly, their plans for continued investment and capacity expansion in combined cycle and then certainly the digital grid management space on the T and D side supports an investment cycle that goes well beyond two years. For the next two years, we feel that the funnel is very, very strong on both sides, both generation as well as transmission and distribution. And so we expect these type of growth rates to continue.

**Q: Looking at where we are in the cycle, with 65% of U.S. trading partners having some form of agreement with The U.S., how has the dialogue with your customers changed?**

**A (Ram Krishnan):** From our perspective, certainly in LNG, Power, Life Sciences, which is the majority of our project funnel that we continue to drive, we have seen no slowdown in decision making or approvals to move projects forward. So that's the most important data point. Now certainly, in terms of some of the sustainability projects in our funnel, and that's not necessarily tariff related, we have seen some project cancellations that have impacted the overall size of our funnel, but not in a meaningful fashion. But the most important thing is where we see the growth in LNG, power, life sciences and certainly even in The U.S. Chemical, petrochemical projects and all of the activity in The Middle East, no slowdown and we continue to yield $350 million to $400 million of project wins a quarter from our $11.2 billion funnel that has been consistent with what we've experienced in the last several quarters.

### Nigel Coe, Wolfe Research

**Q: I think you were pointing to high single digit order rates in the second half of the year. So just wondering if you maybe just double click into where you've seen some of the push outs.**

**A (Lal Karsanbhai):** I did not talk about order push outs, Nigel. That was not one of the elements that we experienced in the quarter. There were dynamics around timing of bookings. Some came earlier in the quarter, some came in July, but we didn't see any dimension of push outs on bookings on capital. And as I mentioned in a prior comment, the MRO activity and booking pace on MRO, which is, as you know, 62% of the business was very steady throughout the quarter.

**A (Ram Krishnan):** The greenfields in which is LNG greenfields, power greenfield, life sciences greenfield and even activity in chemical and ethylene and methanol continue to be positive for us in North America. So no push outs, no slowdowns there. In terms of our funnel, we've seen some moves in sustainability and decarbonization projects in the funnel, but these are not in the quarter or near term type projects. So that was maybe the commentary you picked up. But in terms of greenfield activity, we stay very, very positive on the movement of these projects in North America.

**Q: On the discrete automation, are we seeing a genuine increase in investment from your customers?**

**A (Ram Krishnan):** For us obviously the Test and Measurement growth rates certainly drove a majority of the discrete recovery in terms of momentum. Many markets within Test and Measurement is an inflection. For example, our largest single market is aerospace and defense, and that will see continued momentum in spending across the globe, certainly in Europe and North America where we have the best presence. Semiconductors, both RF and mixed signal, which is where we play, there'll be validation investment, R and D investment as well as capacity investment. And then the broad-based T and M recovery is more a sign of markets getting more confident about the pace of investments and our distributors and integrators restocking on NI. So yes, I would say many parts of our discrete market have inflection points and sustained recovery. But certainly the ones we're watching are factory automation investments out of Germany and China where we haven't seen sustained inflection yet.

**Q: Just touch on this FX pinch to margins. Do you think that's going to be a factor in 4Q as well?**

**A (Mike Baughman):** We are not planning for the FX pinch on margins in the fourth quarter.

### Deane Dray, RBC Capital Markets

**Q: When we were at the Emerson Exchange in San Antonio, we saw that demo of Ovation AI. Is this still in beta test? Has it been launched?**

**A (Lal Karsanbhai):** I noted that on Slide three, Deane, that Ovation Virtual Advisor has been launched and it's integrated in Ovation 4.0. So that's out in the marketplace and we're it's off to a very good looking start already. I'll give an example also of Entergy, which is building two combined cycle 754 megawatt power plants, Mississippi and Texas and they're using the technology. So there's a really good customer adoption there already on that product that you saw as a demo.

**Q: In your Q this morning, there's a reference to the One Big Beautiful bill talking about the accelerated depreciation. Can you just clarify?**

**A (Mike Baughman):** You are correct. That is a reference to ours. And you're also correct that it certainly could be benefit to our customers as they think about CapEx. And just to expand on that a little bit, the provisions of the One Big Beautiful bill are generally favorable for Emerson, avoiding some downsides that were in the outlook as part of TCJA and changing some rates there that will be helpful modestly helpful as we move forward.

### Nicole DeBlase, Deutsche Bank

**Q: I just wanted to ask about the order outlook for 4Q. I think previously it was up high singles. Now we're looking at 5% to 7% growth. Was that driven by a revision in the factory automation outlook?**

**A (Lal Karsanbhai):** No. Look, the process hybrid has remained very consistent for us in terms of outlook. We are still expecting that to exit in the mid-single digits as we were prior. Discrete recovery has been very, very encouraging as we went through the quarter. So double digit exit rate there, still expected. And then safety productivity, there's some comps in there, but lower single digits on that one. And so it's a mix of the different things, 5% to 7% but it's mid to mid-single high.

**Q: Just follow-up on the margin outlook for 4Q. I think you guys said about 27% EBITA margins. Usually margins step down a little bit sequentially in the fourth quarter. Is the divergence versus normal seasonality just driven by the moving pieces around tariffs?**

**A (Ram Krishnan):** Yes. I think for us in the fourth quarter, as if you're talking versus Q3, the fact that we're holding at that 27% clearly is an indication of tariff related pricing getting more favorable in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. We always planned it that way that we would implement the pricing actions in Q3. We'd have a little bit of a headwind as it relates to them fully offsetting tariffs, but then we'll get totally green, as we call it, into Q4. And hence Q4 margin is very solid, up 80 basis points year over year and sequentially flat to Q3.
