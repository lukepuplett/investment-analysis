## Conclusion

Based on the comprehensive valuation analysis, Rocket Lab's current market cap of $11.8B appears reasonable given:
1. Strong revenue growth of 32% YoY
2. Improving gross margins of 28.8%
3. Significant revenue backlog of $1.07B
4. Leading position in small launch market

However, key risks include:
1. High capital requirements for Neutron development
2. Negative free cash flow (-$65.7M TTM)
3. Competitive pressure from SpaceX and Blue Origin
4. Execution risk in reusability and Neutron development

The valuation suggests a base case target of $11.8B, with a bull case of $17.3B and bear case of $6B, reflecting the high-growth, high-risk nature of the space industry.
