CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may constitute “forward-looking statements” for purposes of the federal securities laws. The
information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been provided by us and our management, and such forward-looking statements include
statements relating to the expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future of Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (the “Company”) and its
management team. In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any
underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “potential,”
“predict,” “project,” “should,” “will,” “would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean
that a statement is not forward-looking. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on current expectations and
beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on Rocket Lab. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those
that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other
assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described below and under the heading “Risk Factors.”
• Our ability to effectively manage future growth and achieve operational efficiencies;
• any inability of us to operate our Electron Launch Vehicle (“Electron”) at its anticipated launch rate, including due to any government action related
to launch failure and our ability to operate, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations;
• our inability to develop our Neutron Launch Vehicle (“Neutron”) or significant delays in developing Neutron could adversely impact our business,
financial condition and results of operations;
• our inability to utilize our launch pads at our private launch complex in Mahia, New Zealand or at NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, at Wallops
Island, Virginia with sufficient frequency to support our launch cadence and future related revenue growth expectations;
• our spacecraft, space systems or space system components failing to operate as intended could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations;
• changes in the competitive and highly regulated industries in which we operate, variations in operating performance across competitors, changes in
laws and regulations affecting our business and changes in our capital structure;
• changes in governmental policies, priorities, regulations, mandates or funding for programs in which we or our customers participate, which could
negatively impact our business;
• changes in trade policies, including tariffs;
• loss of, or default by, one or more of our key customers or inability of customers to fund contractual commitments, which could result in a decline
in future revenues, cancellation of contracted launches or space systems orders or termination or default of existing agreements;
• the inability to comply with, and costs associated with complying, any applicable regulations, and specifically, U.S. government contract
regulations, which could result in loss of contract opportunities, contract modifications or termination, assessment of penalties and fines, and
suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting;
• success in retaining or recruiting, or changes required in, officers, key employees or directors, and our ability to attract and retain key personnel,
including Peter Beck, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman;
• defects in or failure of our products to operate in the expected manner, including any launch failure, which could result in a loss of revenue, impact
our business, prospects and profitability, increase our insurance rates and damage our reputation and ability to obtain future customers;
• inability or failure to protect intellectual property;
• disruptions in the supply of key raw materials or components used to produce our products or increases in prices of raw materials;
• the ability to implement our business plans, forecasts and other expectations, including the integration of recently acquired businesses, and to
identify and realize additional opportunities;
Table of Contents
• the diversion of management’s attention and consumption of resources as a result of acquisitions of other companies and success in integrating and
otherwise achieving the benefits of recent and potential acquisitions;
• our inability to effectively integrate or benefit from recently purchased assets or businesses;
• global inflation and interest rates;
• impacts of the wars in Ukraine or Israel or other global conflicts;
• fluctuations in foreign exchange rates;
• the risk of downturns in government and commercial launch services and spacecraft industries;
• our ability to anticipate changes in the markets for rocket launch services, mission services, spacecraft and spacecraft components;
• the inability or failure to comply with contractual requirements or covenants;
• failure to maintain adequate operational and financial resources or raise additional capital or generate sufficient cash flows;
• any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including
those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks; and
• other factors detailed under the section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q entitled “Risk Factors.”
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material
respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Some of these risks and uncertainties may in the future be amplified by a global crises
and/or any response to such a crisis and there may be additional risks that we consider immaterial or which are unknown. It is not possible to predict or identify
all such risks. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.
You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and have filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as exhibits to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the understanding that our actual future results,
levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect. All forward-looking statements are qualified in
their entirety by this cautionary statement.
You should also note that we may announce material business and financial information to our investors using our website (including at
https://investors.rocketlabusa.com), filings with the SEC, webcasts, press releases, and conference calls. We use these mediums, as well as our official

social media channels is not a part of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

ROCKET LAB USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
AS OF MARCH 31, 2025 AND DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND FOR THE
THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2025 AND 2024
(unaudited; in thousands, except share and per share data)
1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS
Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (“Rocket Lab” and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is an end-to-end space
company with an established track record of mission success headquartered in Long Beach, California and is the parent company for several wholly owned
operating subsidiaries located in the United States, New Zealand, Canada and Australia. We deliver reliable launch services, spacecraft design services,
spacecraft components, spacecraft manufacturing and other spacecraft and on-orbit management solutions that make it faster, easier and more affordable to
access space. We operate one of the only private orbital launch ranges in the world, located in Mahia, New Zealand, enabling a unique degree of operational
flexibility and control of customer launch manifests and mission assurance. While our business has historically been centered on the development of smallclass launch vehicles and related sale of launch services, we are currently innovating in the areas of medium-class launch vehicles and launch services, space
systems design and manufacturing, on-orbit management solutions, and space data applications.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principals of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting standards generally accepted in
the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and the requirements of the SEC for interim financial information and include the accounts of Rocket Lab USA,
Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. As permitted under those rules, certain footnotes or other
financial information that are normally required by U.S. GAAP can be condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statements have been
prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, consisting only of
normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary for the fair statement of the Company’s financial information. Certain amounts in the Company’s prior
period condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These interim results are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025, or for any other interim period or for any other future year.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
On an ongoing basis, our management evaluates estimates and assumptions including those related to revenue recognition, contract costs, loss reserves,
valuation of stock-based compensation and deferred tax valuation allowances. We based our estimates on historical data and experience, as well as various
other factors that our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying value of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions.
Other Significant Accounting Policies
There have been no significant changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2025. Refer to Note 2
- Significant Accounting Policies disclosed in the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2024, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2025.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-09, Income Taxes
(Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”), which focuses on the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09
requires a public business entity (“PBE”) to disclose, on an annual basis, a tabular rate reconciliation using both percentages and currency amounts, broken out
into specified categories with certain reconciling items further broken out by nature and jurisdiction to the extent those items exceed a specified threshold. In
addition, all entities are required to disclose income taxes paid, net of refunds received disaggregated by federal, state/local, and foreign and by jurisdiction if
the amount is at least 5% of total income tax payments, net of refunds received. For PBEs, the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. An entity may apply the amendments in ASU 2023-09 prospectively by providing the revised disclosures
for the period ending December 31, 2025 and continuing to provide the pre-ASU 2023-09 disclosures for the prior periods, or may apply the amendments
retrospectively by providing the revised disclosures for all period presented. The Company is assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2023-09 on its
financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (DISE) (“ASU 2024-03”), which requires

assets) and customer advances and deposits (presented within contract liabilities) on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, where applicable. Amounts are
generally billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon milestones. These individual contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on
a contract-by-contract basis on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at the end of each reporting period.
The following table presents the balances related to enforceable contracts as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024:

months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 was not material.
Backlog
The Company’s backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on performance obligations to the Company’s customers for which work remains to
be performed. The amount of backlog increases with new contracts or additions to existing contracts and decreases as revenue is recognized on existing
contracts. Contracts are included in the amount of backlog when an enforceable agreement has been reached. Remaining backlog totaled $1,066,946 as of
March 31, 2025, of which approximately 56% is expected to be recognized within 12 months, with the remaining 44% to be recognized beyond 12 months.

on the commercial customer. Principal and interest payments will be made over 12 quarterly payments from the launch date.
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company had $6,450 and $4,200 customer financing receivable in prepaids and other currents assets,
respectively and $19,417 and $15,567 customer financing receivable in other non-current assets, respectively, on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

The Company has not observed a significant deterioration in credit quality of these securities, which are highly rated with moderate to low credit risk.
Declines in value are largely attributable to current global economic conditions. The securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments, and the
fair values are expected to recover as they approach maturity. The Company does not intend to sell the securities, and it is not more likely than not that the
Company will be required to sell the securities, before the respective recoveries of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity. As of March 31, 2025,
the Company had not recognized an allowance for credit losses on any marketable securities in an unrealized loss position.

10. LOAN AGREEMENTS
Indenture and Notes
On February 6, 2024, the Company issued $355,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.250% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Notes”). The
Notes were issued pursuant to, and are governed by, an indenture (the “Indenture”), dated as of February 6, 2024, between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust
Company, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”).
The Notes are the Company’s senior, unsecured obligations and are (i) equal in right of payment with the Company’s existing and future senior,
unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to the Company’s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes in right of payment;
(iii) effectively subordinated to the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness, including borrowings under its equipment financing agreement, to the
extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities,
including trade payables, and (to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof) preferred equity, if any, of the Company’s subsidiaries.
The Notes accrue interest at a rate of 4.250% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on
August 1, 2024. The Notes mature on February 1, 2029, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Before November 1, 2028, noteholders have the
right to convert their Notes only during the following circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) if the last reported
sale price of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for each of at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a
period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, (ii) during the five
consecutive business day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period, or the measurement period, in which the trading price per $1 principal amount of
Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock and the
applicable conversion rate on each such trading day, (iii) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions specified in the Indenture or (iv) if the
Company calls such Notes for redemption. From and after November 1, 2028, noteholders may convert their Notes at any time at their election until the close
of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as
applicable, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Company’s election. The initial conversion rate is
195.1029 shares of common stock per $1 principal amount of Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $5.13 per share of common
stock. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, if certain corporate
events that constitute a “Make-Whole Fundamental Change” (as defined in the Indenture) occur, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be
increased for a specified period of time. As of March 31, 2025, the holder of the Notes have the right to convert between April 1, 2025 and June 30, 2025
because the Company’s common stock price exceeded the applicable conversion price by 130% for the specified period of time during the quarter ended
March 31, 2025.
When a conversion notice is received, the Company has the option to pay or deliver cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination
thereof. Since the issuance of the Notes, the Company has not received a notice from the holders. As of March 31, 2025, the Company cannot be required to
settle the Notes in cash and has the intent and ability to settle in common stock, therefore, the Notes were classified as non-current liabilities on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheet.
As of March 31, 2025, there was $355,000 outstanding under the Notes, before unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of $9,074. As of March 31,
2025, the effective interest rate under the Notes was 5.0%.

Capped Call Transactions
In connection with the pricing of the Notes, on February 1, 2024 and February 2, 2024, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call
transactions (the “Capped Call Transactions”) with certain financial institutions. Collectively, the Capped Call Transactions cover, subject to customary
adjustments, the number of shares of common stock initially underlying the Notes. The cost of the Capped Call Transactions was $43,168. The Capped Call
Transactions are expected generally to reduce or offset the potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon exercise of the Notes and/or the Company’s
election to offset the cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the Notes upon conversion of the Notes in the event
that the market price per share of the Company’s common stock is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions (which initially corresponds to
the initial conversion price of the Notes and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions), with such reduction and/or
offset subject to a cap based on the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions. The Capped Call Transactions have an initial cap price of $8.04 per share of the
Company’s common stock, which represents a premium of 100% over the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock on February 1, 2024.
The Capped Call Transactions do not meet the criteria for separate accounting as a derivative as they are indexed to the Company’s stock. The premiums
paid for the Capped Call Transactions have been included as a net reduction to additional paid-in capital within shareholders’ equity.
Trinity Master Equipment Financing Agreement
On December 29, 2023 (the “Effective Date”), the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (the “Subsidiaries”, together with the Company, the
“Borrowers”), entered into a Master Equipment Financing Agreement (the “Trinity Loan Agreement”) with Trinity Capital, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the
“Lender”) to provide financing for certain equipment and other property (the “Equipment”). The Trinity Loan Agreement provides that the Lender shall provide
equipment financing in the aggregate of up to $120,000 (the “Conditional Commitment”), with advances (“Draws”) to be made as follows: (i) $70,000 on the
Effective Date (the “Effective Date Draw”); and (ii) $40,000 to be drawn on the Effective Date (the “Blanket Lien Draw”), with each of the Effective Date
Draw and Blanket Lien Draw payable over sixty (60) months beginning January 2024, with the final payments due in January 2029. After the Blanket Lien
Draw was repaid in full, Borrowers may make Draws as follows: (x) $30,000 to be drawn in not more than three advances of at least $10,000 each at the
Borrowers’ option no later than the date that is 18 months after the Effective Date; and (y) $20,000 to be drawn at Borrower’s option between January 1, 2025
and June 30, 2025 (such date, the “Termination Date”), subject to customary conditions.
The Company repaid an existing term loan with the proceeds from the Trinity Loan Agreement and Blanket Lien Draw. The monthly payment factors
under the Trinity Loan Agreement and Blanket Lien Draw have a term of sixty (60) months and a rate factor of 0.022266. In connection with the Trinity Loan
Agreement, the Company issued warrants to Lender to acquire 728,835 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $4.87 per share.
On February 8, 2024, the Company paid off all obligations under the Blanket Lien Draw in the amount of $38,778, which includes principal, unpaid
interest and legal fees, resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1,330 for the three months ended March 31, 2024.
On March 20, 2025, the Company made a draw of $25,000 under the Trinity Loan Agreement (the “March 2025 Draw”). This March 2025 Draw has a
term of sixty (60) months and a rate factor of 0.022266.
As of March 31, 2025, there was $80,386 outstanding under the Trinity Loan Agreement, before unamortized discount and debt issuance and end of term
costs of $2,168, of which $20,490 is classified as current installments of long-term borrowings in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets, with
the remainder classified as long-term borrowings, net, excluding current installments. As of March 31, 2025, the effective interest rate under the Trinity Loan
Agreement was 15.8%. The Company is required to pay end of term charges of $700 and $250 upon repayment of the Effective Date Draw and the March 2025
Draw, respectively.

11. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Preferred Stock
The Company entered into an exchange agreement dated December 3, 2024 with The Equatorial Trust (the “Trust”), a family trust established by Sir
Peter Beck (“Sir Peter”), the Company’s Founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, to exchange (the “Preferred Stock Exchange”) 50,951,250
shares of the Company’s common stock into 50,951,250 shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per
share (the “Preferred Stock”). On January 7, 2025, the Preferred Stock Exchange was consummated (the “Closing”) and the Company filed the Certificate of
Designation for the Preferred Stock (the “Certificate of Designation”) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which became effective upon filing.
At the Closing, the Company issued 50,951,250 shares of Preferred Stock to the Trust.
The common stock exchanged in the Preferred Stock Exchange were reacquired at no cost and held in treasury stock until they are reissued or retired.
The fair value of the Preferred Stock issued was determined to be equal to the fair value of the common stock exchanged.
The Preferred Stock has the rights and restrictions set forth in a Certificate of Designation. Each share of Preferred Stock is convertible at any time at the
option of the holder of the Preferred Stock (a “Holder”) into a number of shares of Common Stock at the then-applicable conversion rate (the “Conversion
Rate”). In addition, each share of Preferred Stock automatically converts into a number of shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate upon the earliest to
occur of (a) a transfer of such share (other than to a Permitted Transferee), (b) the first date on which Sir Peter no longer serves as (i) the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company or (ii) such other executive officer position of the Company as approved by the Board, (c) Sir Peter’s death or permanent disability, or
(d) the first date on which the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock no longer represent a minimum beneficial ownership by Sir Peter of five percent. A
“Permitted Transferee” is defined in the Certificate of Designation and includes Sir Peter and his controlled affiliates. The Preferred Stock is not redeemable by
the Company at any time.
The Certificate of Designation also provides that for so long as any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Holders, voting exclusively and as a
separate class, will be entitled to designate and elect at least one individual to serve on the Board as a director (a “Preferred Stock Director”). In the event the
Board increases its size to more than 10 members, the Holders are entitled to designate and elect, voting exclusively and as a separate class, one or more
additional Preferred Stock Directors in order to maintain the right to elect ten percent of the total number of authorized directorships, rounded up to the nearest
whole number. The right to designate a Preferred Stock Director is nontransferable.
Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, after the satisfaction in full of the Company’s debts
and the payment of any liquidation preference ranking senior to the Preferred Stock, Holders are entitled to receive an amount equal to $0.0001 per share of
Preferred Stock. Following the payment of the full amount of the liquidation preference in respect of all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, Holders
participate pari passu with the holders of the Common Stock (on an as-if-converted-to-Common-Stock basis) in the net assets of the Company.
The Preferred Stock is not entitled to any scheduled dividend payments. Holders will be entitled to receive dividends on shares of Preferred Stock equal
(on an as-if-converted-to-common-stock basis) to, and in the same form as dividends actually paid on, all or substantially all of the shares of common stock
when, as and if such dividends (other than dividends in the form of common stock) are paid on shares of the common stock, subject to certain exceptions
specified in the Certificate of Designation.

The Preferred Stock will have the right to vote on all matters submitted for a vote of the holders of the common stock, voting together as a single class
with the common stock. Each Holder will be entitled to cast a number of votes per share equal to the number of shares of common stock into which a share of
Preferred Stock is convertible. In addition, the Company may not, without the affirmative vote of the Holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock: (a) alter, amend or repeal any provision of the Company’s certificate of incorporation if it would alter or change the powers, preferences or
special rights of the Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely, (b) alter or amend the Certificate of Designation, or (c) increase the authorized number of
shares of Preferred Stock or authorize the issuance of additional shares of Preferred Stock.
At-The-Market Of ering
On March 11, 2025, the Company entered into an ATM Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with BofA Securities, Inc., Cantor
Fitzgerald & Co., Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated and TD Securities (USA) LLC (collectively, the “Sales Agents”), pursuant to which the Company
may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Shares”) having an aggregate offering price of up to
$500,000 through the Sales Agents, acting as its agents, or directly to the Sales Agents, acting as principal (the “ATM Equity Offering”).
As of March 31, 2025, the Company had sold 4,858,839 shares of common stock and generating $92,806 in gross proceeds, before deducting $2,703 in
underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses.
12. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Equity Incentive Plans
The Company has a single active equity incentive plan, the Rocket Lab 2021 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “2021 Plan”), with the objective of
attracting and retaining available employees and directors by providing stock-based and other performance-based compensation. The Rocket Lab 2013 Stock
Option and Grant Plan (the “2013 Plan”) was terminated, but outstanding awards granted thereunder remain governed by it. The 2021 Plan provides for the
grant of equity awards to officers, employees, directors and other key employees as well as service providers which include incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, unrestricted stock awards, restricted stock units or any combination of the foregoing any of which may be
performance based, as determined by the Company’s Compensation Committee. An aggregate of 59,875,000 shares were initially reserved for the issuance of
awards under the 2021 Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan automatically increases each January 1, beginning on January 1,
2022, by 5% of the outstanding number of shares of common stock on the immediately preceding December 31, or such lesser amount as determined by the
plan administrator. The Company was authorized to issue up to 111,709,596 shares of common stock as equity awards to participants under the 2021 Plan as of
March 31, 2025. There were 92,489,567 shares of common stock available for grant as of March 31, 2025.
Total stock-based compensation recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss during the three months ended
March 31, 2025 and 2024 consisted of the following:
Three Months Ended March 31,
Stock-based compensation 2025 2024
Cost of revenues $ 3,920 $ 3,503
Research and development, net 4,894 3,985
Selling, general and administrative 10,420 5,605
Total stock-based compensation expense $ 19,234 $ 13,093
Options
Options issued to all optionees under the 2013 Plan vested over four years from the date of issuance (or earlier vesting start date, as determined by the
board of directors) as follows: 25% on the first anniversary of date of grant and the remaining vest monthly over the remaining vesting term. All options had
vested as of March 31, 2025.
Restricted Stock Units
During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company granted 369,388 and 7,221,561 restricted stock units, respectively, to certain key
employees pursuant to the 2021 Plan. The time-based service vesting condition is generally satisfied over periods of approximately four years as the employees
provide service.
As of March 31, 2025, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested performance-based restricted stock units granted under the 2013
Plan and 2021 Plan was $114,806 and will be recognized upon vesting.

2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In August 2021, the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2021 ESPP”) was approved to reserve 9,980,000 shares of common stock for issuance for
awards in accordance with the terms of the 2021 ESPP. In addition, the number of shares reserved for issuance will ultimately increase on January 1 of each
year from 2022 to 2031 by the lesser of (i) 9,980,000 shares of common stock, (ii) 1% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of the close of
business on the immediately preceding December 31 or (iii) the number of common stock shares as determined by the Company’s board of directors. The
purpose of the 2021 ESPP is to enable eligible employees to use payroll deductions to purchase shares of common stock and thereby acquire an interest in the
Company. Eligible employees are offered shares through a 12-month offering period, which consists of two consecutive 6-month purchase periods. Employees
may purchase a limited amount of shares of our stock at a discount of up to 15% of the lesser of the fair market value at the beginning of the offering period or
the end of each 6-month purchase period.
No shares were issued under the 2021 ESPP during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. As of March 31, 2025, 20,183,297 shares remain
available for issuance under the 2021 ESPP. Total ESPP stock-based compensation recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 was $1,574 and $939, respectively. As of March 31, 2025, the total unrecognized
compensation expense related to the 2021 ESPP was $2,020 and will be recognized over the remaining offering period.
13. LEASES
The Company has operating and finance leases for properties, vehicles and equipment. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of less than
one year to twenty-five years, some of which include options to extend the lease term, and some of which include options to terminate the lease prior to the end
of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably
certain that the Company will exercise such options.
As of March 31, 2025, there have been no material changes in the Company’s lease portfolio since December 31, 2024.
14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Litigation and Claims
The Company is, and from time to time may be, a party to claims and legal proceedings generally incidental to its business that are principally covered
under contracts with its customers and insurance policies. In the opinion of management, there are no legal matters or claims likely to have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
Other Commitments
The Company has commitments under its lease obligations (see Note 13).
Contingencies
The Company records a contingent liability when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If these
estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.
Contingencies are inherently unpredictable, and the assessments of the value can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely
heavily on estimates and assumptions.
In connection with the acquisition of SolAero Holdings, Inc. in January 2022, the Company assumed a contract with a customer to provide solar panel
module at a fixed price. The Company determined that it was probable that the costs to complete the solar panel modules as stipulated by the contract would
exceed the fixed firm price of the solar panel modules.
The provision for contract losses outstanding as of March 31, 2025, which primarily is related to the solar panel module agreement, was $6,235 included
in other current liabilities in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.

15. INCOME TAXES
Income tax provision and the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 were as follows:
Three Months Ended March 31,
2025 2024
Benefit (provision) for income taxes $ 813 $ (5)
Effective tax rate 1.3 % (0.0)%
The tax provisions for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 were computed using the estimated effective tax rates projected to be applicable
for domestic and international taxable jurisdictions for the full year as adjusted for discrete items arising during each quarter.
The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to a full valuation allowance against our US deferred tax assets, as well as the
impact of discrete items that may occur in any given year but which are not consistent from year-to-year.
Due to net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards, the U.S. federal and state returns are open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state
jurisdictions for all years beginning with the year ended March 31, 2016. Our foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to examination within four years from
the end of the tax year during which the tax return was filed. The years subject to audit may be extended if the entity substantially understates corporate income
tax. The Company is not currently under examination in the United States by the Internal Revenue Service or state and local tax authorities. The Company is
not currently under examination in New Zealand. We are under audit by the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and
December 31, 2022. The audit is in the early information request stage and the Company is engaged in discussions with the CRA on the matter. Given the early
stage of these discussions, we will continue to monitor for any developments and their impact, if any, to our provision for income taxes.
16. NET LOSS PER SHARE
Common Stock
The holder of each share of common stock has the right to one vote for each share and is entitled to notice of any stockholders’ meeting and to vote upon
certain events.
Preferred Stock
The holder of the Preferred Stock has similar rights and characteristics to common stock and for the purposes of the calculation of earnings per share, the
Preferred Stock is treated as common stock.
Earnings Per Share Calculation
Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during each period.
Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common and
dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding for the period using the treasury-stock method and the if-converted method, whichever is more dilutive.
Potentially dilutive shares are comprised of restricted stock units, stock options and shares underlying our convertible senior notes. For the three months ended
March 31, 2025 and 2024, there is no difference in the number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted shares outstanding due to the Company’s net loss
and potentially dilutive shares being anti-dilutive.
The following table summarizes the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of the Company for the
three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024:

17. SEGMENTS
The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews financial information presented based on a management approach for the purposes of making
operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources. The Company manages its business primarily based upon two operating
segments, launch services and space systems. Each of these operating segments represents a reportable segment. Launch Services provides launch and launch
related services to customers on a dedicated mission or ride share basis. Space systems is predominately comprised of spacecraft components and spacecraft
manufacturing. Although some of the Company’s contracts with customers contain elements of space systems and launch services, each reporting segment is
managed separately to better align with customer’s needs and the Company’s growth plans. For contracts with customers that contain both space systems and
launch services elements, revenues for each reporting segment are generally allocated based upon the overall costs incurred for each of the reporting segments
in comparison to total overall costs of the contract. The following table shows information by reportable segment for the three months ended March 31, 2025
and 2024:

19. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On May 8, 2025, the Company announced the intent to implement a reorganization of its corporate legal structure by executing a tax-free merger of
Rocket Lab USA, Inc. with and into Rocket Lab Merger Sub, Inc., a newly formed Delaware corporation that is a subsidiary of a newly formed Delaware
corporation, Rocket Lab Corporation (“Rocket Lab Corporation”). As a result of the transaction, Rocket Lab Corporation will become the holding company for
the Company and its subsidiaries and Rocket Lab Corporation will be the publicly traded entity.
Immediately after consummation of the transaction, Rocket Lab Corporation will have, on a consolidated basis, the same assets, businesses, operations,
executive officers, officers and directors as the Company had immediately prior to the consummation of the transaction. Upon completion of the new structure,
which we are targeting to occur prior to June 1, 2025, the Company’s common stock will continue trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on an uninterrupted
basis with no change to the ticker symbol “RKLB.” Existing shares of Rocket Lab will automatically convert on a one-for-one basis into shares of common
stock of Rocket Lab Corporation. The transaction will be accomplished pursuant to Section 251(g) of the Delaware General Corporation Law and no action
will be required by the Company’s stockholders.

Overview
Rocket Lab is an end-to-end space company with an established track record of mission success. We deliver reliable launch services, spacecraft design
services, spacecraft components, spacecraft manufacturing and other spacecraft and on-orbit management solutions that make it faster, easier and more
affordable to access space.
While our business has historically been centered on the development of small-class launch vehicles and the related sale of launch services, we are
currently innovating in the areas of medium-class launch vehicles and launch services, space systems design and manufacturing, on-orbit management
solutions, and space data applications. Each of these initiatives addresses a critical component of the end-to-end solution and our value proposition for the
space economy:
• Launch Services is the design, manufacture, and launch of orbital rockets to deploy payloads to various Earth orbits and interplanetary destinations.
• Space Systems is the design and manufacture of spacecraft components and spacecraft program management services, space data applications and
mission operations.
Electron is our orbital small launch vehicle that was designed from the ground up to accommodate a high launch rate business model to meet the
growing and dynamic needs of our customers for small launch services. Since its maiden launch in 2017, Electron has become the leading small spacecraft
launch vehicle delivering over 200 spacecraft to orbit for government and commercial customers across 59 successful missions through March 31, 2025. In
2024, Electron was the second most frequently orbital launched rocket by companies operating in the United States and the second most frequent orbital
launcher globally. Our launch services program has seen us develop many industry-leading innovations, including 3D printed electric turbo-pump rocket
engines, fully carbon composite first stage fuel tanks, a private orbital launch complex, a rocket stage that can be configured to convert into a highly capable
spacecraft on orbit, and the potential ability to successfully recover a stage from space, providing a path to reusability.
In March 2021, we announced plans to develop our reusable-ready medium-capacity Neutron launch vehicle that will increase the payload capacity of
our space launch vehicles to approximately 15,000 kg for expendable launches to low Earth orbit and lighter payloads for reusable configurations and into
higher orbits. Neutron will be tailored for commercial and U.S. government constellation launches and ultimately configurable for and capable of human space
flight, enabling us to provide crew and cargo resupply to space stations. Neutron will also provide a dedicated service to orbit for larger civil, defense and
commercial payloads that need a high level of schedule control and high-flight cadence. We expect to be able to leverage Electron’s flight heritage across
various vehicle subsystems designs, launch complexes and ground station infrastructure.

Table of Contents
Our space systems initiatives are supported by the design and manufacture of our spacecraft family along with a range of components, software and
services for spacecraft, including reaction wheels, star trackers, radios, separation systems, solar solutions, command and control spacecraft software, high
voltage space grade battery solutions, and additional products in development to serve a wide variety of sub-system functions. We entered this market with our
acquisition of leading spacecraft components manufacturer Sinclair Interplanetary, and have since expanded our market participation with the acquisitions of
Planetary Systems Corporation, SolAero Technologies Corp. and aerospace software firm Advanced Solutions, Incorporated. Each of these strategic
acquisitions brought incremental vertically-integrated capabilities for our own spacecraft family and also enabled Rocket Lab to deliver high-volume
manufacturing of critical spacecraft components and software solutions at scale prices to the broader spacecraft merchant market. Our spacecraft family, which
are configurable for a range of low Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, geosynchronous orbit and interplanetary missions enable us to offer an end-to-end mission
solution encompassing launch, full spacecraft manufacturing, ground services and mission operations to provide customers with streamlined access to orbit
with Rocket Lab as a single mission partner.
Recent Developments
Impact of Tarif s
Beginning in early April 2025, there has been a significant shift in U.S. trade policy, characterized by increased tariffs and the introduction of new tariffs
that could affect our supply chain and business operations. While much of our production is completed in the U.S. and many of our suppliers are located within
and source their supply from within the U.S., we obtain some of our supplies from sources outside of the U.S. and certain of our consolidated subsidiaries are
headquartered outside of the U.S. as well. Although some of these tariffs have been temporarily suspended or reduced, certain tariffs remain in effect, and some
may be reinstated following the temporary suspension period currently articulated by the U.S., and as such tariffs could have a material adverse impact on our
business, our results of operations and our cash flow. The extent of the impact of these tariffs will depend on various factors, including the specific products
affected, the duration and amount of the tariffs the rates imposed by the U.S. and any reciprocal tariffs implemented by countries in which we operate or source
goods, and our ability to manage increased costs. While we plan to implement measures to mitigate the effects of tariffs and other trade policy changes, such as
negotiating with suppliers, adjusting our supply chain, and exploring cost-saving initiatives, our capacity to do so may be constrained by operational and supply
chain limitations, particularly in the short term. To date, our business has not been materially impacted by this shift in U.S. trade policy and, to the extent we
are able, we plan to continue to implement strategies to mitigate any potential impact of any new or ongoing tariffs or further shifts in U.S. trade policy.
Key Factors Affecting Our Performance
Ability to timely develop and successfully deploy Neutron launch vehicle
Our future results will depend on the success of the development and commercial acceptance of our Neutron medium-capacity launch vehicle. While we
have made significant progress across Neutron’s structures and infrastructure to date, including engine testing and initial production execution, the commercial
development of a new launch vehicle is inherently time consuming and involves numerous risks throughout the engineering and manufacturing development
cycle, any of which could create delays in reaching the initial launch and future launches of the completed vehicle. In addition, even if we succeed in
developing Neutron consistent with our targeted timeline, we could be unsuccessful in developing the ability to produce these launch vehicles in quantities and
with the necessary quality manufacturing system that ensures each vehicle and engines perform as required. Any delay in the production of the Neutron launch
vehicle or in our ability to produce these launch vehicles at our expected rate of production and with a reliable quality management system could have a
material impact on customer acceptance as well as our future revenue, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, delays or setbacks in Neutron
development may require more research, development and capital expenditures than we currently anticipate, which could adversely affect our liquidity and
capital resources in future periods.

Table of Contents
Ability to sell additional launch services, space systems service and spacecraft components to new and existing customers
Our results will be impacted by our ability to sell our launch services, space systems services, and spacecraft components to new and existing customers.
We have successfully launched Electron 59 times delivering over 200 spacecraft to orbit, including one suborbital launch, through March 31, 2025. We have
flight hardware and spacecraft that have flown on over 1,800 missions, including legacy missions enabled by Sinclair Interplanetary (acquired April 2020),
Advanced Solutions, Incorporated (acquired October 2021), Planetary Systems Corporation (acquired November 2021) and SolAero Technologies Corp.
(acquired January 2022). Our growth opportunity is dependent on our ability to expand our addressable launch services market with larger volumetric and
higher mass payload capabilities of our in-development medium-capacity Neutron launch vehicle, which will address large commercial and government
constellation launch opportunities. Our growth opportunity is also dependent on our ability to win spacecraft constellation missions and expand our portfolio of
strategic spacecraft components. Our ability to sell additional products to existing customers is a key part of our success, as follow-on purchases indicate
customer satisfaction and decrease the likelihood of competitive substitution. To sell additional products and services to new and existing customers, we will
need to continue to invest significant resources in our products and services.
Ability to improve profit margins and scale our business
We intend to continue to invest in initiatives to improve our operating leverage and significantly ramp production. We believe continued reduction in
costs and an increase in production volumes will enable the cost of launch vehicles to decline and improve our gross margins. Our ability to achieve our
production-efficiency objectives could be negatively impacted by a variety of factors including, among other things, lower-than-expected facility utilization
rates, manufacturing and production cost overruns, increased purchased material costs and unexpected supply-chain quality issues or interruptions.
Government expenditures and private enterprise investment into the space economy
Government expenditures and private enterprise investment has fueled the growth in our target markets. We expect the continued availability of
government expenditures and private investment for our customers to help fund purchases of our products and services will remain. This is an important factor
in our company’s growth prospects.
Key Metrics and Select Financial Data
We monitor the following key financial and operational metrics that assist us in evaluating our business, measuring our performance, identifying trends
and making strategic decisions.
Launch Vehicle Build-Rate and Launch Cadence
We built approximately 12 Electron launch vehicles in 2022, approximately 11 Electron launch vehicles in 2023 and approximately 14 Electron launch
vehicles in 2024. We built approximately 6 Electron launch vehicles through the three months ended March 31, 2025. We launched nine Electron vehicles in
2022, ten Electron vehicles in 2023 and 16 Electron vehicles in 2024. We have launched five Electron vehicles through the three months ended March 31,
2025. Growth rates between launches and total launch service revenue are not perfectly correlated because our total revenue is affected by other variables, such
as the revenue per launch, which can vary considerably based on factors such as unique orbit and insertion requirements, payload handling needs, launch
location, time sensitivity of mission completion and other factors.
Revenue Growth
Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 and 2024
We generated $122.6 million and $92.8 million in revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively, representing a year-onyear increase in revenue of approximately 32%. This year-on-year increase resulted from space systems revenue growth of $26.9 million, primarily driven by
satellite manufacturing, and an increase in launch revenue of $2.9 million. Launch revenue growth was due to a higher launch cadence with five Electron
launch missions completed in the three months ended March 31, 2025, versus four launch missions completed in the three months ended March 31, 2024,
partially offset by a lower revenue per launch.
26
Table of Contents
Revenue and Cost Value Per Launch
Revenue value per launch represents the average revenue per launch contract attributable to launches that occurred during a period, regardless of when
the revenue was recognized. Revenue value per launch can be a useful metric to provide insight into general competitiveness and price sensitivity in the
marketplace. Revenue value per launch can vary considerably, based on factors such as unique orbit and insertion requirements, payload handling needs,
launch location, time sensitivity of mission completion and other factors, and as such may not provide absolute clarity with regards to pricing and competitive
dynamics in the marketplace.
Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 and 2024
In the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, our revenue value per launch was $7.1 million and $8.2 million, respectively. Meanwhile, cost per
launch for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 was $5.7 million and $6.1 million, respectively. Revenue and cost per launch can fluctuate
depending on customer mix and mission type.
Backlog
Backlog represents future revenues that we would recognize in connection with the completion of all contracts and purchase orders that have been
entered into by our customers but have not yet been fulfilled, excluding any customer options for future products or services that have not yet been exercised.
Contracts for launch services and spacecraft builds typically include termination rights that may be exercised by customers upon advanced notice and payment
of a specified termination fee. Our backlog remained virtually unchanged from $1,067.0 million as of December 31, 2024 to $1,066.9 million as of March 31,
2025, of which $644.8 million is related to space systems and $422.1 million is related to launch services. The slight change was a result of recognizing
revenue on contracts during the period, offset by continued bookings during the period.
Components of Results of Operations
Revenue
Our revenues are derived from a combination of long-term fixed price contracts for launch services and spacecraft builds, and purchase order based
spacecraft components sales. Revenues from long-term contracts are recognized using either the “point-in-time” or “over-time” method of revenue recognition.
Point-in-time revenue recognition results in cash payments being initially accrued to the balance sheet as deferred revenue as contractual milestones are
accomplished and then recognized as revenue once the final contractual obligation is completed. Over-time revenue recognition is generally based on an input
measure of progress based on costs incurred compared to estimated total costs at completion. Each project has a contractual revenue value and an estimated
cost. The over-time revenue is recognized based on the percentage of the total project cost that has been realized.
Estimating future revenues and associated costs and profit is a process requiring a high degree of management judgment, including management’s
assumptions regarding our future operational performance as well as general economic conditions. Frequently, the period of performance of a contract extends
over a long period of time and, as such, revenue recognition and our profitability from a particular contract may be affected to the extent that estimated costs to
complete are revised, delivery schedules are delayed, performance-based milestones are not achieved or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded.
Accordingly, our recorded revenues and operating profit from period to period can fluctuate significantly depending on when the point-in-time or over-time
contractual obligations are achieved. In the event cost estimates indicate a loss on a contract, the total amount of such loss is recorded in the period in which the
loss is first estimated.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consists primarily of direct material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, freight expense, depreciation and amortization and other
personnel-related expenses, which include salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, directly associated with generating revenues. We
expect our cost of revenues to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we sell more launch services and space systems. As we grow into our current
capacity and execute on cost-reduction initiatives, we expect our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue to decrease over time.
Because direct labor costs and manufacturing overhead comprise a significant portion of cost of revenues, increasing our production rate resulting in
greater absorption of these costs is our most critical cost reduction initiative. Increasing our production rate is a cross-functional effort involving sales and
business development, manufacturing, engineering, supply chain and finance.

Operating Expenses
Our operating expenses consist of research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses.
Research and Development, net
Research and development, net expense consists primarily include labor, prototype, professional services, materials, facilities and depreciation expense.
We intend to continue to make significant investments in developing new products and enhancing existing products, including but not limited to our medium
capacity Neutron launch vehicle, Electron’s first stage recovery, and spacecraft features and capabilities, as well as expanding our portfolio of spacecraft
components and subsystems. Research and development expense will be variable relative to the number of products that are in development, validation or
testing. However, we expect it to decline as a percentage of total revenue over time.
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for our sales, marketing, supply chain, finance, legal,
human resources and administrative personnel, as well as the costs of customer service, information technology, risk management and related insurance, travel,
allocated overhead and other marketing, communications and administrative expenses. We also expect to further invest in our corporate infrastructure and incur
additional expenses associated with operating as a public company, including increased legal and accounting costs, investor relations and compliance costs. As
a result, we expect that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods but decline as a percentage of total
revenue over time.
Interest Income (Expense), Net
Interest income (expense), net consists primarily of interest expense incurred on debt and interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, shortterm investments balances and marketable securities.
Gain (Loss) on Foreign Exchange
Gain (loss) on foreign exchange relates to currency fluctuations that generate foreign exchange gains or losses on invoices denominated in currencies
other than the United States (“U.S.”) Dollar.

ended March 31, 2024. The effective tax rate was 1.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to (0.0)% for the three months ended March 31,
2024. The effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to a full valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Since inception, we have funded our operations with proceeds from sales of our capital stock, convertible senior notes, term note debt, equipment
financing, research and development grant proceeds, and cash flows from the sale of our products and services. As of March 31, 2025, we had $303.1 million
of cash and cash equivalents and $209.2 million of marketable securities. Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are for investment in new products
and technologies, the expansion of existing manufacturing facilities, working capital, debt service, acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or
technologies and general corporate needs. Historically, these cash requirements have been met through the net proceeds we received through private sales of
equity securities and convertible senior notes, borrowings under our credit and equipment financing facilities, net proceeds received in our business
combination, net proceeds received from our ATM Equity Offering and payments received from customers.
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and payments from customers will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital
expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months, although we may choose to take advantage of opportunistic capital raising or refinancing transactions at
any time primarily for the purposes noted above. We will continue to invest in increasing production and expanding our product offerings through acquisitions.
Material Cash Requirements
As of March 31, 2025, we had outstanding $435.4 million in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under our convertible senior notes and
equipment financing agreement, of which $20.5 million was scheduled to become due in the following twelve months. As of March 31, 2025, our total
minimum lease payments was $100.1 million, of which $11.0 million is due in the following twelve months. For details regarding our indebtedness and lease
obligations at March 31, 2025, refer to Note 10, Loan Agreements, and Note 13, Leases, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
30
Table of Contents
Our capital expenditures for the three months ended March 31, 2025 were $28.7 million. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors,
including our launch cadence, traction in the market with our space systems offerings, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of
spending to support product development efforts, the introduction of new and enhanced products, the continuing market adoption of our products, the timing
and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest in existing and new office spaces and the number of acquisitions of complementary businesses, products
or technologies we pursue, if any. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing or we may choose to take advantage of opportunistic capital
raising or financing transactions primarily for the purposes noted above. In the event that we require additional financing, we may not be able to raise such
financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in
continued product innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, operations and financial condition.
Additionally, we expect our capital and operating expenditures will increase significantly in connection with ongoing activities as we:
• increase our investment in marketing, advertising, sales and distribution infrastructure for our existing and future products and services;
• develop additional new products and enhancements to existing products;
• obtain, maintain and improve our operational, financial and management performance;
• hire additional personnel;
• obtain, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and
• continue to operate as a public company.
Indebtedness
As of March 31, 2025, there was $355.0 million outstanding under our 4.250% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029, before unamortized discount and
debt issuance costs of $9.1 million. In addition, as of March 31, 2025, there was $80.4 million outstanding under the Trinity Loan Agreement, before
unamortized discount and debt issuance and end of term costs of $2.2 million.
See Note 10 of Item 1 for additional information on our outstanding loan agreements.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:
Three Months Ended March 31,
(in thousands) 2025 2024
Net cash provided by (used in):
Operating activities $ (54,225) $ (2,588)
Investing activities (28,601) (52,256)
Financing activities 115,503 258,707
Effect of exchange rate changes 272 (519)
Net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 32,949 $ 203,344
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $54.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and consisted of $60.6 million in net loss, $29.2
million in non-cash activities and $22.8 million in cash used by operating assets and liabilities. Included in the non-cash activities are $19.2 million in stockbased compensation expense and $8.7 million in depreciation and amortization. Included in the cash used by operating assets and liabilities are $9.6 million in
prepaids and other current assets, $9.3 million in contract liabilities, $6.3 million in inventories, offset by cash provided in operating assets and liabilities
including $9.8 million in trade payables.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025 of $28.6 million was primarily driven by $28.7 million of capital equipment
and infrastructure investments.
31
Table of Contents
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025 of $115.5 million was primarily related to $90.7 million of net
proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the ATM Equity Offering and $24.7 million of net proceeds from a draw under the Trinity Loan Agreement.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in our audited financial statements included in our
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2025.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under applicable SEC rules.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due
to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and
interest rates and inflation. In addition, we are subject to broader market risk that is created by the global market disruptions and uncertainties resulting from
macroeconomic challenges, geopolitical events, tariffs, trade and other international disputes.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, and the functional currency of each of our subsidiaries is either its local currency or the U.S. dollar. The assets
and liabilities of each of our subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at each balance sheet date and operations accounts are
translated using the average exchange rate for the relevant period. Increases or decreases in the relative value of the U.S. dollar to other currencies may
positively or negatively affect revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency translation adjustments are accounted for as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders’ equity. Gains or losses due to transactions in foreign currencies are
reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of operations under the line item “Loss on foreign exchange.” Materially all of our revenues are
denominated in U.S. dollars and we have not engaged in the hedging of foreign currency risk to date, although we may choose to do so in the future. As such, a
10% or greater move in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar could have a material impact on our financial results and position.
Interest Rate Risk
As of March 31, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents of $303.1 million, comprised primarily of operating accounts and money market instruments
and $209.2 million invested in marketable securities, comprised of commercial paper, corporate debt securities, bank certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury bills
and notes and asset backed securities. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial
instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure.
Impact of Inflation
We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Nonetheless, if our costs were to
become subject to significant inflationary pressures it could diminish our margin thereby limiting our profits, especially if we are not able to fully offset such
higher costs. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and
principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
As required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2025.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there were no changes in the our internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”)
identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s ICFR.
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. Our management believes that
there are currently no claims or actions pending against us, the ultimate disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or
financial condition.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
Other than as noted below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2025.
Changes in trade policies, including tarif s, could cause adverse impacts to our business.
Beginning in April 2025, we observed a significant shift in U.S. trade policy, with increased tariffs and the imposition of new tariffs that could impact
our supply chain and our business. Even though our suppliers are primarily domestic, we rely on some imported materials, components, or finished goods, and
if tariffs increase, our supply chain costs may rise, adversely affecting our business, results of operations and cash flows. We also operate businesses in Canada
and New Zealand, which support our domestic business, which increases our potential exposure to the impact of any tariff.
While certain of such tariffs have been temporarily paused as currently articulated by the U.S. government, any further changes in trade policies, such as
new tariffs, increases in tariffs, imposition of previously paused tariffs or reactionary measures including retaliatory tariffs, legal challenges, or currency
manipulation, could adversely impact us. Additionally, retaliatory measures, or prolonged uncertainty in trade relationships could result in supply chain
disruptions, delayed shipments, or increased operational complexity, which could also adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. While
we intend to take steps to mitigate any impacts of tariffs or other impacts resulting from changes in trade policy, our ability to do so may be limited by
operational and supply chain constraints, especially in the short term.
Item 2. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds
None.
Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities
None.
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures
None.
