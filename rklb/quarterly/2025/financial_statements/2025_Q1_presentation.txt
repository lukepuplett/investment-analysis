Forward Looking Statements
This presentation may contain certain “forward-looking statements” within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of
historical facts, contained in this presentation, including statements regarding
our expectations of financial results for the second quarter of 2025, strategy,
future operations, future financial position, projected costs, prospects, plans
and objectives of management, are forward-looking statements. Words such as,
but not limited to, “anticipate,” “aim,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “continue,”
“could,” “design,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,”
“potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “suggest,” “strategy,” “target,”
“will,” “would,” and similar expressions or phrases, or the negative of those
expressions or phrases, are intended to identify forward-looking statements,
although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.
These forward-looking statements are based on Rocket Lab’s current
expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential
effects. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks,
uncertainties (many of which are beyond Rocket Lab’s control), or other
assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially
different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
Many factors could cause actual future events to differ materially from the
forward-looking statements in this release, including risks related to delays and
disruptions in expansion efforts; delays in the development of our Neutron
rocket; our dependence on a limited number of customers; the harsh and
unpredictable environment of space in which our products operate which could
adversely affect our launch vehicle and spacecraft; increased competition in
our industry due in part to rapid technological development; technological
change in our industry which we may not be able to keep up with or which may
render our services uncompetitive; average selling price trends; general
economic uncertainty and turbulence which could impact our customers’
ability to pay what we are owed; failure of our launch vehicles, spacecraft and
components to operate as intended either due to our error in design, in
production or through no fault of our own; launch schedule disruptions; supply
chain disruptions, product delays or failures; design and engineering flaws;
launch failures; natural disasters and epidemics or pandemics; any inability to
effectively integrate recently acquired assets; a US government shutdown or
delays in government funding; changes in governmental regulations including
with respect to trade and export restrictions, or in the status of our regulatory
approvals or applications; or other events that force us to cancel or reschedule
launches, including customer contractual rescheduling and termination rights;
risks that acquisitions may not be completed on the anticipated time frame or
at all or do not achieve the anticipated benefits and results; and the other risks
detailed from time to time in Rocket Lab’s filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including under the heading “Risk Factors” in
Rocket Lab’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2024, which was filed with the SEC on February 27, 2025 and elsewhere.
There can be no assurance that the future developments affecting Rocket Lab
will be those that we have anticipated. Except as required by law, Rocket Lab is
not undertaking any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking
statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our unaudited consolidated financial statements presented on
a basis consistent with GAAP, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial
measures, including non-GAAP gross margin, operating expenses, research and
development expenses, and non-GAAP net selling, general and administrative
expenses. These supplemental measures exclude the effects of (i) stock-based
compensation expense; (ii) amortization of purchased intangible assets and
favorable lease; (iii) non-cash income tax benefits and expenses (iv)
depreciation; (v) transaction costs; (vi) change in fair value of contingent
consideration; (vii) performance reserve escrow; (viii) provision for income
taxes; (ix) (Gain) loss on foreign exchange; (x) accretion of marketable
securities purchased at a discount; (xi) (gain) loss on disposal of assets; and
(xii) employee retention credit. We also supplement our unaudited historical
statements and forward-looking guidance with the measure of adjusted
EBITDA, where adjustments to EBITDA include share-based compensation,
warrant expense related to customers and partners, foreign exchange gains or
losses, acquisition related performance reserve and escrow, loss on
extinguishment of debt, interest expense, net and other non-recurring gains or
losses. These non-GAAP measures should only be viewed in conjunction with
corresponding GAAP measures. We compensate for the limitations of nonGAAP financial measures by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete
picture of our performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in
accordance with and do not serve as an alternative for the presentation of our
GAAP financial results. We are providing this information to enable investors to
perform more meaningful comparisons of our operating results in a manner
similar to management's analysis of our business. We believe that these nonGAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts
associated with our GAAP results of operations. We encourage investors to
review the detailed reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP presentations in
our Earnings Release dated May 8, 2025 available on our website at
investors.rocketlabusa.com. We have not provided a reconciliation for the
forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures because, without unreasonable
efforts, we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the amount and
timing of adjustments that are used to calculate these non-GAAP financial
measures, particularly related to stock-based compensation and its related tax
effects.

FINANCIAL
HIGHLIGHTS
AND OUTLOOK
SECTION
04
REVIEW OF REVENUE AND GROSS MARGINS Revenue increased 32.1% or $29.8M year-on-year, driven by
an increase in launches from 4 to 5 as well as growth in our
Space Systems business, driven primarily by our SDA
satellite manufacturing contract and component businesses.
Sequential revenue decrease of 7.4% quarter-over-quarter,
or $9.8M, driven by lower priced Electron launches within the
quarter as well as a shift in program contribution within our
satellite manufacturing business as MDA contribution rolls
off and SDA contribution ramps.
Quarter-on-Quarter Q1 GAAP gross margin increase was
driven by improved mix within our satellite manufacturing
business, partially offset by decreased launch margin due to
a lower launch ASP in the quarter.
Quarter-on-Quarter Q1 Non-GAAP gross margin slight
decrease reflects a mix of lower margin launch, paired with a
decreased amount of stock-based compensation in cost of
goods sold under our EAC program accounting.

remaining 44% to be recognized beyond 12 months.
Healthy pipeline including multi-launch deals and large
Satellite Manufacturing contracts can create lumpiness
in backlog growth given the size and complexities of
these opportunities.

GAAP and Non-GAAP SG&A expense decreased modestly
due primarily to a decrease in software licenses, paired with
a slight step down in non-recurring transaction costs.
GAAP and Non-GAAP R&D expense increased due to
increased software license costs, paired with a step-up in
Neutron development spending, in particular; propulsion as
we continue to qualify the Archimedes engine, complete
tank prototypes and other vehicle structures.
QUARTER-ON-QUARTER
REVIEW OF OPERATING EXPENSES
28 Rocket Lab | Q1 2025 Financial Update
$517M in cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities
and restricted cash, end of period in Q1 2025.
Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized
software increased $7.2M sequentially to $28.7M as we
accelerate our Neutron infrastructure investments
across the pad at LC3 at Wallops VA, the second engine
test stand at Stennis MS, and our large composite
structure facility at Middle River MD.
Negative GAAP Operating Cash Flow increased $51.8M
sequentially, primarily driven by materially lumpy cash
receipts from our SDA satellite program, paired with
continued Neutron investment and longer lead
procurement for SDA and subsequent Neutron tails and
related infrastructure to scale the business beyond our
initial test flight.
Adj. EBITDA loss increased $6.8M sequentially due to the
slight decrease in revenue quarter-over-quarter paired
with an increase in R&D spending related to Neutron.
Note: Non-GAAP free cash flow is defined as GAAP operating cash flow reduced by purchases of property, equipment and software.
Consistent with past practice, we have defined adjusted EBITDA to reflect adjustments for stock-based compensation, transaction costs, depreciation
and amortization, FX gains and losses, interest expense, warrant expense, taxes, acquisition related performance reserve escrow, and other recurring
and non-recurring items. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP presentations in our Earnings Release dated May 8, 2025
