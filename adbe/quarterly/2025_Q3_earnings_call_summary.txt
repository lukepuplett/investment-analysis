He emphasized the integration of AI across flagship Creative Cloud applications and noted strong adoption of the standalone Firefly subscription. Narayen also announced, "Adobe GenStudio is the most comprehensive solution that brings together workflow and planning, creation and production, asset management, activation and delivery and reporting and insights to enable marketing automation with AI in the enterprise." The company surpassed its full-year AI-first ending ARR target, with AI-influenced ARR now exceeding $5 billion.

David Wadhwani, President of Digital Media, reported Digital Media revenue of $4.46 billion and described rapid adoption of Acrobat AI Assistant and Adobe Express, with Acrobat AI Assistant units up more than 40% quarter-over-quarter and AI system engagement growing nearly 50% quarter-over-quarter. He cited key customer wins and partnerships, including with the state of California to expand student access to AI tools.

Anil Chakravarthy, President of Digital Experience, stated Digital Experience revenue reached $1.48 billion, with subscription revenue at $1.37 billion. He referenced, "LLM traffic grew 4,700% year-over-year in July 2025" and detailed the launch of the AEP Agent Orchestrator and early access for the LLM Optimizer product.

Daniel Durn, CFO, said "In Q3, we exceeded our targets and once again delivered double-digit top line and EPS growth." He noted cash flows from operations of $2.20 billion, remaining performance obligations of $20.44 billion, and a share repurchase agreement totaling $2.50 billion.

Daniel Durn provided Q4 FY25 targets: total Adobe revenue of $6.075 billion to $6.125 billion, Digital Media segment revenue of $4.53 billion to $4.56 billion, Digital Experience segment revenue of $1.495 billion to $1.515 billion, and GAAP earnings per share of $4.27 to $4.32. For the full year, Adobe now targets total revenue of $23.65 billion to $23.70 billion and GAAP EPS of $16.53 to $16.58, raising both metrics from the previous quarter's guidance. Durn stated, "Based on our momentum, we are pleased to raise our media ending ARR growth target, and given our Q4 targets, we are raising the full year total revenue and GAAP and non-GAAP EPS targets."

Financial Results
Adobe delivered Q3 revenue of $5.99 billion and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.18, with non-GAAP EPS of $5.31, reflecting 11% and 14% year-over-year growth, respectively. Digital Media segment revenue was $4.46 billion, with ending ARR of $18.59 billion, up 11.7% year-over-year. Digital Experience revenue reached $1.48 billion, and cash flow from operations set a Q3 record at $2.20 billion. Durn highlighted, "ARR from our new AI-first products including Firefly, Acrobat AI Assistant and GenStudio for performance marketing has already achieved our end-of-year target of over $250 million."

Q&A
Keith Weiss, Morgan Stanley, asked about the value proposition of Adobe's integration with third-party AI models and risk from single-channel marketers. David Wadhwani replied that "the core of the choice of whatever model has the most interesting thing for the thing you want to do, you know you can turn to Adobe, and it will be there." Shantanu Narayen added, "The magic is clearly in our applications because we can take all of the models that exist and integrate that within our interface."

Bradley Sills, BofA Securities, inquired about drivers of AI-first product ARR outperformance. Narayen answered, "the overarching GenStudio solution is definitely seeing a lot of great adoption, AI Assistant in Acrobat and everything that we're doing associated with AI Acrobat... we've seen significant momentum and easily crossed the $250 million mark."

Tyler Radke, Citi, questioned pricing dynamics and migration to Creative Cloud Pro. Narayen responded, "the migration was extremely healthy but that was not in itself. The reason for the strength we are seeing actually strength across the board."

Aleksandr Zukin, Wolfe Research, asked about sustained double-digit DM ARR growth. Narayen stated, "we definitely feel confident about how large the Creative opportunity is and how differentiated our solutions are."

Michael Turrin, Wells Fargo, queried about margin impact from AI adoption. Durn explained, "That focus and clarity on those real drivers of growth serves the company well in this environment... It's a combination of all of these elements that come to bear and deliver a strong margin profile."

Saket Kalia, Barclays, asked about AI's effect on retention and commercial safety. Wadhwani observed, "there is a direct correlation between increased use of AI and retention, and we feel very good about that." He also emphasized the importance of commercially safe models for enterprise customers.

Sentiment Analysis
Analyst sentiment was positive, with multiple questions highlighting outperformance of AI-first products and raised financial targets. Questions often sought clarity on AI monetization drivers and competitive positioning, but tone remained constructive and forward-looking.

Management maintained a confident and optimistic tone in both prepared remarks and Q&A. Direct quotes such as "we are pleased to raise our full year total revenue and GAAP and non-GAAP EPS targets" and "we feel very good about the engine of innovation and the velocity" signal strong confidence in growth prospects.

Compared to the previous quarter, both analysts and management demonstrated increased conviction regarding AI monetization, product integration, and the ability to sustain double-digit growth.

Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison
Full-year revenue and EPS guidance were raised, and AI-influenced ARR growth accelerated from over $3.5 billion at the end of FY24 to over $5 billion in Q3. Last quarter, the company had already raised FY25 guidance but now increased it further, reflecting stronger-than-anticipated AI product adoption.

Management tone was more assertive in describing Adobe's leadership in AI integration and ARR achievements. Analyst questions shifted from early adoption indicators to deeper inquiries about monetization mix, pricing, and retention driven by AI.

Key metric changes include higher Digital Media ARR, continued rapid adoption of Acrobat AI Assistant, Firefly, and GenStudio, and a record quarter for cash flow from operations.

Risks and Concerns
Competitive risk from advertising platforms integrating their own diffusion engines was discussed, with management emphasizing Adobe's differentiation through workflow integration and multi-model support.

Potential shift from seat-based to consumption-based revenue models in Creative Cloud was addressed, but management reiterated confidence in both seat expansion and automated solutions as growth drivers.

Analysts raised questions about retention in the context of AI adoption and intellectual property issues, to which management stressed the importance of commercially safe models and their appeal to enterprise clients.

Final Takeaway
Adobe delivered a quarter marked by record revenue, double-digit growth, and notable acceleration in AI-driven product adoption. The company raised both its revenue and EPS guidance for FY25, with AI-influenced ARR surpassing $5 billion and early achievement of its $250 million AI-first product ARR target. Management attributed these results to innovation, strong customer demand, and successful integration of AI across its flagship offerings, while highlighting continued momentum going into the fourth quarter.
