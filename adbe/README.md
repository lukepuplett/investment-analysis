## October 2025 Thoughts

### The AI Growth Paradox: Why 10% Overall Growth is Actually Bullish

**The Question**: If AI products are growing 40%+ quarter-over-quarter, why is overall revenue growth only 10%?

**The Answer**: This is actually a **feature, not a bug** - and it's why Adobe is such a compelling investment.

#### The Math Behind the Growth
- **Total Revenue**: $23.18B TTM (massive scale)
- **AI-Influenced ARR**: ~$5B (22% of revenue, growing 25%+)
- **AI-First Products**: ~$250M (1% of revenue, growing 40%+)
- **Traditional Business**: ~$18B (78% of revenue, growing 8-10%)

**Reality Check**: When 78% of your business grows at 8-10%, even explosive growth in the remaining 22% results in moderate overall growth. But this is exactly what we want to see.

#### Why This is Actually Bullish

**1. Sustainable Transformation**
- Adobe isn't building a small, fast-growing company
- It's successfully **transforming a massive, stable business**
- AI growth is **additive**, not replacing existing revenue
- This creates a much more defensible and valuable business

**2. Quality of Growth**
- **$2.3B** in new annual revenue (massive absolute growth)
- **96% recurring revenue** (predictable and sticky)
- **89% gross margins** (exceptional profitability)
- **High switching costs** (AI integration creates lock-in)

**3. The Trajectory is Accelerating**
- AI revenue growing from 22% to 30%+ of total
- Overall growth accelerating from 10% to 12-15%
- Premium pricing on AI features increasing ARPU
- Enterprise adoption driving higher contract values

**4. Market Expansion**
- **AI Creative Tools TAM**: $8B → $35B (34% CAGR)
- **New customer acquisition** through AI-first products
- **Cross-selling opportunities** across product portfolio
- **International expansion** with AI as differentiator

#### The Investment Case

**Current Valuation**: 22.4x P/E (attractive for quality growth)
**Target Price**: $450-500 (30-45% upside potential)
**Time Horizon**: 2-3 years
**Risk Level**: Medium

**Key Catalysts**:
- AI monetization acceleration
- Enterprise AI adoption
- Market share gains in AI creative tools
- International expansion
- New AI-first product launches

**Bottom Line**: Adobe is successfully executing a **massive business transformation** while maintaining financial discipline and market leadership. The 10% growth rate represents **$2.3B in new annual revenue** - equivalent to entire mid-cap companies. As AI becomes a larger portion of the business, overall growth will accelerate while maintaining the quality and predictability that makes Adobe such a compelling investment.

**Recommendation**: Strong Buy - Adobe represents one of the best risk-adjusted opportunities in the AI transformation space.
