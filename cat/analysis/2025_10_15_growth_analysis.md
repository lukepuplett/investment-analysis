# Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) – Growth Analysis

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Analyst:** Investment Analysis Repository  
**Most Recent Quarter:** Q2 2025 (Ended June 30, 2025)

## Executive Summary

**BLUF: Caterpillar demonstrates **moderate cyclical growth** with TTM revenue of $63.1B, reflecting near-term headwinds from tariff impacts (-$1.3-1.5B annual) and competitive pricing pressure. Historical growth is cyclical with 5-year revenue CAGR of 2.1% (reflecting peak-to-peak cycle). Key growth drivers include **record $37.5B backlog** (+$8.9B YoY), infrastructure investment tailwinds, energy transition (data center boom +28% YoY), and technology leadership. Growth is **cyclical in nature** with secular tailwinds from infrastructure spending and energy transition. **Recommendation: HOLD** - Near-term headwinds offset by strong backlog visibility and long-term secular growth catalysts.**
