## Executive Summary

**BLUF: DoorDash stock declined -10.4% after Q3 earnings ($238 → $213.24) due to disappointing Q4 guidance showing flat sequential Adjusted EBITDA growth ($754M Q3 → $760M midpoint Q4) and increased 2026 investment plans suggesting margin compression. At current price of $213.24, DASH trades at 9.0x Price/Sales (down from 10.10x) and 56.3x Forward P/E (down from 62.89x). DCF analysis suggests fair value range of $200-$280 per share, with current price at lower end reflecting near-term margin compression concerns. Q4 guidance conservative but 2026 investment plans create margin headwinds. RECOMMENDATION: BUY - Stock decline creates buying opportunity; valuation more attractive after decline, but near-term margin compression expected from increased investment.**

DoorDash trades at premium valuation multiples reflecting growth expectations and profitability achievement. DCF analysis suggests fair value range based on growth assumptions and terminal margin expectations. Comparable company analysis shows premium to peers justified by superior growth and profitability metrics. PEG ratio indicates attractive valuation for growth. Valuation supported by accelerating growth, profitability achievement, and strong cash generation, though premium multiples require continued execution to justify.
