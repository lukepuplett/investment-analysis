**Analysis Date:** November 5, 2025  
**Event:** Q3 2025 Earnings Release and Market Reaction  
**Stock Price Impact:** $238.00 → $213.24 (-10.4% decline)

---

## Executive Summary

**BLUF: DoorDash Q3 2025 earnings beat expectations with strong revenue growth (+27% YoY) and profitability (4.6% operating margin TTM), but stock declined -10.4% due to disappointing Q4 guidance showing flat sequential Adjusted EBITDA growth ($754M Q3 → $760M midpoint Q4) and increased 2026 investment plans. Investors likely concerned about margin compression and slower profitability growth despite strong execution. RECOMMENDATION: Market overreaction - Q4 guidance conservative but 2026 investment plans suggest margin headwinds, creating buying opportunity if growth investment yields returns.**

DoorDash delivered strong Q3 2025 results but stock declined -10.4% after earnings due to Q4 guidance showing essentially flat sequential Adjusted EBITDA growth and announcement of increased 2026 investment spending. The market reaction suggests investors were expecting faster sequential growth and margin expansion, but instead got conservative guidance and plans for increased investment that may compress margins near-term.

## Q4 2025 Guidance Analysis

### Guidance vs. Expectations

| Metric | Q4 2025 Guidance | Q3 2025 Actual | Sequential Growth | Analysis |
|--------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Marketplace GOV** | $28.9B - $29.5B | $25.02B | +15.5% - +17.9% | Strong growth expected |
| **Adjusted EBITDA** | $710M - $810M | $754M | -5.8% to +7.4% | **Flat sequential growth** |

**Key Observations:**

1. **Marketplace GOV Growth:** Strong sequential growth expected (15.5% - 17.9%)
   - Midpoint: $29.2B (+16.7% Q/Q)
   - Suggests continued strong order volume and GOV growth

2. **Adjusted EBITDA Guidance:** Essentially flat sequential growth
   - Midpoint: $760M (+0.8% Q/Q) vs Q3's $754M
   - **Disappointing** - investors likely expected faster sequential growth

3. **Sequential Margin Compression:**
   - Q3 Adjusted EBITDA margin (as % of GOV): 3.0%
   - Q4 midpoint margin: 2.6% (assuming $29.2B GOV and $760M EBITDA)
   - Suggests margin compression despite GOV growth

### Why Guidance Disappointed

**1. Flat Sequential EBITDA Growth:**
- Q3: $754M Adjusted EBITDA
- Q4 midpoint: $760M (+0.8% Q/Q)
- Investors likely expected 5-10% sequential growth
- Actual guidance suggests margin compression despite GOV growth

**2. Deliveroo Integration Impact:**
- Q4 Deliveroo contribution: $45M Adjusted EBITDA
- Without Deliveroo, organic EBITDA would be ~$715M (midpoint)
- Implies organic EBITDA declining Q/Q

**3. Increased Investment Spending:**
- 2026 investment plans: "several hundred million dollars more" than 2025
- Suggests margin compression in 2026
- Investors concerned about profitability growth trajectory

## Conclusion

DoorDash delivered strong Q3 2025 results but stock declined -10.4% after earnings due to Q4 guidance showing essentially flat sequential Adjusted EBITDA growth and announcement of increased 2026 investment spending. The market reaction suggests investors were expecting faster sequential growth and margin expansion, but instead got conservative guidance and plans for increased investment that may compress margins near-term.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Q3 results were strong (27% revenue growth, 7.5% operating margin)
- Q4 guidance disappointed (flat sequential EBITDA growth)
- 2026 investment plans suggest margin compression
- Stock decline may create buying opportunity for long-term investors

**Updated Investment Case:** Strong execution achieving profitability with accelerating growth, but Q4 guidance conservative and 2026 investment plans create margin headwinds. Stock decline may create buying opportunity if growth investment yields returns, but near-term margin compression expected.
