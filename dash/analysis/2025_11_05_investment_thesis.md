## Executive Summary

**BLUF: DoorDash stock declined -10.4% after Q3 earnings ($238 → $213.24) due to disappointing Q4 guidance showing flat sequential Adjusted EBITDA growth ($754M Q3 → $760M midpoint Q4) and increased 2026 investment plans suggesting margin compression. Strong Q3 results (27% YoY revenue growth, 7.5% operating margin) demonstrate execution and profitability, but Q4 guidance conservative and 2026 investment plans create margin headwinds. At current price of $213.24, stock trades at fair value (aligned with Base Case DCF) creating buying opportunity. Investment thesis remains intact with sustainable competitive advantages, market leadership, and long-term growth opportunities, but near-term margin compression expected. RECOMMENDATION: BUY - Stock decline creates buying opportunity; strong execution achieving profitability with accelerating growth, but near-term margin compression expected from increased investment.**

DoorDash represents a compelling investment opportunity as the market leader in U.S. restaurant delivery with accelerating growth, achieving profitability milestone, and generating strong cash flow. The company has sustainable competitive advantages including scale, network effects, brand strength, and technology leadership that support continued market leadership and profitability. Strategic acquisitions strengthen international position and create a stronger global platform. The investment thesis is supported by large TAM, category expansion, international growth, and improving unit economics driving continued strong performance.
