## Investment Thesis
Fluor represents a compelling value opportunity in infrastructure and energy transition markets with strong balance sheet protection ($2.3B cash, low debt) and substantial backlog ($28.2B, 80% reimbursable) providing revenue visibility. Current pullback to $46.32 (-3.60% today) improves risk-reward profile ahead of Q3 earnings (Nov 7, 2025). The company faces near-term headwinds from infrastructure project execution issues and client hesitancy due to trade uncertainty, but maintains leading positions in LNG and mining EPC markets with strong long-term secular tailwinds. **Recommendation: BUY for value investors with execution risk tolerance - Fair value $52 per share represents 12% upside, with earnings catalyst ahead.**
