This presentation contains forward-looking statements (including without limitation statements to the effect that the Company or its
management "will," "believes," "expects," "plans," "intends," "continue," "anticipates," is "positioned" or other similar expressions). These
forward-looking statements, including statements relating to resolution of outstanding claims or lawsuits, strategic and operational plans,
projected operating results, forecasts, market outlook, new awards, backlog levels, prospects, capital allocation plans and liquidity are
based on current management expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially as a result of a number
of factors described in our form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Caution must be exercised in relying on these and other
forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning risk factors that could affect the Company's business and financial results
can also be found in the Company's public periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 2024 10-K. The
Company disclaims any intent or obligation other than as required by law to update its forward-looking statements in light of new

During this presentation, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures including consolidated segment profit (loss), adjusted
EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. Reconciliations of non-GAAP amounts to the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release
and are posted in the investor relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com. Reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial
measures are not available due to the inability to reliably estimate the amounts of items excluded from such measures. Unless otherwise
noted, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Company's 2024 Form 10-K.
