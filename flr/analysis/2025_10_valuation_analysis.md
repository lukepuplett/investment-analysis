## Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

### DCF Assumptions

**Base Case Scenario:**

| Assumption                | 2025E | 2026E | 2027E | 2028E | 2029E | Terminal |
|---------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Revenue ($B)               | 17.0  | 18.5  | 20.0  | 21.5  | 23.0  | --       |
| Revenue Growth             | 5%    | 9%    | 8%    | 8%    | 7%    | 3%       |
| Adjusted EBITDA Margin     | 3.0%  | 3.5%  | 4.0%  | 4.5%  | 5.0%  | 5.0%     |
| Adjusted EBITDA ($M)       | 510   | 648   | 800   | 968   | 1,150 | --       |
| Operating Cash Flow ($M)   | 225   | 425   | 600   | 750   | 900   | --       |
| Capital Expenditures ($M) | -150  | -150  | -150  | -150  | -150  | -150     |
| Free Cash Flow ($M)        | 75    | 275   | 450   | 600   | 750   | --       |
| FCF Margin                 | 0.4%  | 1.5%  | 2.3%  | 2.8%  | 3.3%  | 3.3%     |

**Rationale for FCF Growth Relative to Revenue:**
- **Revenue Growth:** Modest 5-9% annually driven by backlog execution and new awards
- **FCF Growth:** Significantly faster due to:
  1. **Legacy Project Funding Declining:** Embedded in Operating Cash Flow - declines from $200M (2025) to $0 (2029) as projects resolve
  2. **Infrastructure Projects Completing:** Removes cost overrun drag and improves margins (Gordie Howe 97% complete, others completing)
  3. **Execution Improvement:** Better project execution reduces working capital absorption and cost overruns
  4. **Mix Shift:** Higher margin reimbursable work (80% of backlog) supports margin expansion
  5. **Operating Leverage:** Revenue growth with relatively fixed cost base improves cash conversion

**Why FCF Grows Faster Than Revenue:**
- **2025E:** Operating Cash Flow $225M (guidance $200-250M midpoint) includes ~$200M legacy project funding drag
- **2026E:** Legacy funding reduces to ~$150M, infrastructure projects complete, Operating Cash Flow improves to $425M
- **2027E:** Legacy funding further reduces to ~$100M, execution improves, working capital efficiency, Operating Cash Flow $600M
- **2028E:** Legacy funding minimal (~$50M), normalized operations, margin expansion, Operating Cash Flow $750M
- **2029E:** Legacy funding ends ($0), normalized FCF margin at 3.3%, Operating Cash Flow $900M

**Key Insight:** The FCF growth isn't from revenue growth alone - it's primarily from **removing the legacy project drag** ($200M annually embedded in operating cash flow) and completing problematic infrastructure projects. Revenue grows modestly (35% over 5 years), but FCF grows dramatically (900% over 5 years from $75M to $750M) because we're removing a $200M annual cash drag embedded in operating cash flow.

**Key Assumptions:**
- **WACC:** 9.5% (reflecting business risk and capital structure)
- **Terminal Growth:** 3% (long-term GDP growth)
- **Tax Rate:** 30% (management guidance)
- **Terminal EBITDA Multiple:** 10x (moderate infrastructure multiple)
- **Legacy Project Funding:** Declines from $200M (2025) to $0 (2029) as projects resolve - embedded in operating cash flow
- **Capital Expenditures:** Consistent ~$150M annually for maintenance and growth
- **Working Capital:** Absorbs cash during growth phases but stabilizes over time as execution improves

### DCF Valuation Results

**Base Case DCF:**
- **Present Value of Cash Flows (2025-2029):** $1.8B
- **Terminal Value:** $5.2B
- **Enterprise Value:** $7.0B
- **Equity Value:** $8.2B
- **Shares Outstanding:** 161.7M
- **Target Price:** **$51 per share**
- **Upside:** +10% from current price of $46.32 (improved from $46.20)

**Note:** DCF valuation reflects the dramatic FCF improvement from legacy project funding declining ($200M → $0) and infrastructure projects completing, which drives FCF growth far exceeding revenue growth.

**Bull Case DCF (Higher Growth, Better Margins):**
- **Target Price:** **$65 per share**
- **Upside:** +40% from current price of $46.32

**Bear Case DCF (Lower Growth, Margin Pressure):**
- **Target Price:** **$38 per share**
- **Downside:** -18% from current price of $46.32

## Market Update: Current Pullback & Upcoming Earnings

**Date:** November 4, 2025  
**Current Price:** $46.32  
**Today's Change:** -3.60% (-$1.73)  
**Upcoming Earnings:** November 7, 2025 (3 days away)

### Pullback Assessment

**Context:**
- Stock down -3.60% today from previous close of $48.05
- Current price: $46.32
- 52-week range: $29.20 - $60.10 (currently mid-range)
- Upcoming Q3 2025 earnings: November 7, 2025

**Possible Reasons for Pullback:**
1. **Pre-Earnings Positioning:** Normal volatility ahead of earnings (3 days away)
2. **Sector Weakness:** Broader infrastructure/construction sector pressure
3. **Earnings Concerns:** Market concerns about Q3 results given Q2 guidance reduction
4. **Execution Risk:** Ongoing concerns about infrastructure project execution

**Assessment: Pre-Earnings Positioning**
- Pullback appears to be normal pre-earnings volatility
- Q2 guidance reduction (EBITDA $475-525M, EPS $1.95-2.15) may create uncertainty
- Strong balance sheet ($2.3B cash) provides downside protection
- Valuation remains attractive at current levels

**Risk-Reward Profile:**
- **At $48.05:** Upside 8-19% to fair value $52-59
- **At $46.32:** Upside **12-27%** to fair value $52-59 (improved)
- **Risk:** Downside limited to $35-40 in bear case (-13% to -24%)

**Earnings Catalyst:**
- Q3 2025 earnings on Nov 7, 2025 (3 days away)
- Key metrics to watch:
  - Adjusted EBITDA vs. guidance ($475-525M)
  - Adjusted EPS vs. guidance ($1.95-2.15)
  - Infrastructure project progress updates
  - Cash flow generation
  - Bookings and backlog changes
  - NuScale monetization updates

**Entry Strategy:**
- **Pre-Earnings:** Consider buying at current levels ($46.32) if comfortable with earnings risk
- **Post-Earnings:** Wait for earnings results if prefer to avoid volatility
- **Add-on:** If pullback extends to $42-44 range post-earnings
- **Stop:** Consider below $38-40 if fundamentals deteriorate significantly

**Conclusion:** Current pullback improves risk-reward profile ahead of earnings. Fair value remains $52-59, representing 12-27% upside from current price. Earnings on Nov 7 will provide clarity on execution progress and may drive significant volatility.
