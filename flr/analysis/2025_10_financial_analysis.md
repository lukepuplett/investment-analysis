# Fluor Corporation (FLR) – Financial Analysis

**Analysis Date:** October 2025  
**Most Recent Quarter:** Q2 2025 (Ended June 30, 2025)

## Executive Summary

**BLUF: Fluor Corporation shows mixed financial performance with strong balance sheet fundamentals ($2.3B cash, low debt) but faces near-term headwinds from infrastructure project cost issues and client hesitancy. Q2 2025 adjusted EBITDA declined 42% YoY to $96M, but the company maintains a robust $28.2B backlog (80% reimbursable) providing visibility. Strong recovery potential exists once trade uncertainty resolves and infrastructure projects complete. Hold recommendation - value investors seeking infrastructure exposure with execution risk tolerance.**

### Profitability Drivers
- **Q2 EBITDA Decline:** Adjusted EBITDA fell 42% YoY to $96M, driven by:

  - Reduced contributions from Energy Solutions as LNG Canada Train 1 completes
  - Slower ramp-up on life sciences project
  - Lower take-up on mining projects
- **Segment Margins:** Urban Solutions segment profit margin compressed to 1.4% (from 5.7% YoY) due to infrastructure charges
- **Gross Margin Compression:** Gross margin declined from 3.5% in 2024 to 3.0% TTM, reflecting project mix and cost pressures
- **Operating Leverage:** Operating margin of 0.45% TTM indicates thin margins, requiring volume growth and cost discipline

## Investment Implications

### Positive Factors
- Strong balance sheet provides cushion for operations and capital allocation
- Large backlog provides revenue visibility
- Reimbursable mix reduces risk exposure
- Recovery potential once infrastructure projects complete and trade uncertainty resolves

### Risk Factors
- Near-term margin pressure from infrastructure project issues
- Cash flow volatility and working capital management challenges
- Client hesitancy impacting bookings and growth trajectory
- Execution risk on remaining infrastructure projects

### Recommendation
**Hold for value investors with execution risk tolerance.** The company has strong fundamentals but faces near-term headwinds. Recovery potential exists once infrastructure projects complete and trade uncertainty resolves, but requires patience and risk tolerance for execution challenges.
