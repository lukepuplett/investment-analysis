# Fluor Corporation (FLR) – Business Overview: What They Build and For Whom

**Analysis Date:** November 2025  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive overview of Fluor's business operations, projects, and client relationships

---

## What Fluor Does

**Fluor Corporation is an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contractor.** They design, procure materials, and build large industrial and infrastructure projects for clients around the world.

Think of Fluor as the "construction company" for massive industrial facilities - they don't manufacture products themselves, they build the facilities where others manufacture or operate.

### Business Model

Fluor operates through three main segments:

1. **Urban Solutions** (~73% of backlog): Infrastructure, mining & metals, advanced manufacturing, life sciences, data centers
2. **Energy Solutions** (~20% of backlog): LNG, power generation, chemicals, refining
3. **Mission Solutions** (~7% of backlog): National security, DOE projects, defense infrastructure

### Contract Types

- **Reimbursable Contracts (80% of backlog):** Client pays Fluor's costs plus a fee - lower risk for Fluor
- **Fixed-Price Contracts (20%):** Fluor takes on cost risk - higher risk but potentially higher margins
- **Services-Only Contracts:** Engineering and project management without material procurement
