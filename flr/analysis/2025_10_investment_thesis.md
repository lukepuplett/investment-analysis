# Fluor Corporation (FLR) – Investment Thesis

**Analysis Date:** October 2025  
**Most Recent Quarter:** Q2 2025 (Ended June 30, 2025)

## Executive Summary

**BLUF: Fluor represents a compelling value opportunity in infrastructure and energy transition markets with strong balance sheet protection ($2.3B cash, low debt) and substantial backlog ($28.2B, 80% reimbursable) providing revenue visibility. Current pullback to $46.32 (-3.60% today, Nov 4, 2025) improves risk-reward profile ahead of Q3 earnings (Nov 7, 2025). The company faces near-term headwinds from infrastructure project execution issues and client hesitancy due to trade uncertainty, but maintains leading positions in LNG and mining EPC markets with strong long-term secular tailwinds. Risk-reward profile is balanced with strong downside protection but requires tolerance for execution risk and earnings volatility. Recommendation: BUY for value investors with execution risk tolerance, with earnings catalyst ahead.**
