# Fluor Corporation (FLR) – Risk Assessment

**Analysis Date:** October 2025  
**Most Recent Quarter:** Q2 2025 (Ended June 30, 2025)

## Executive Summary

**BLUF: Fluor faces moderate to high risk levels driven by execution challenges on infrastructure projects, cyclical market headwinds from trade uncertainty, and cash flow volatility. However, the company's strong balance sheet ($2.3B cash), low debt ($1.07B), and 80% reimbursable backlog provide significant risk mitigation. Key risks include infrastructure project execution, client hesitancy from trade uncertainty, and legacy project funding. Risk-reward profile is balanced with strong downside protection but execution risks requiring monitoring. Hold recommendation - risk-tolerant investors seeking infrastructure exposure with strong balance sheet protection.**
