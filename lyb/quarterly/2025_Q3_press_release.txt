(1) See "Information Related to Financial Measures" for a discussion of the company's use of non-GAAP financial measures and Tables 2-6 for reconciliations or calculations of these financial measures. "Identified items" include adjustments for lower of cost or market ("LCM"), gain or loss on sale of business, asset write-downs in excess of $10 million in aggregate for the period, Cash Improvement Plan costs, Dutch PO joint venture exit costs, European transaction costs and discontinued operations.

(2) Cash conversion is net cash provided by operating activities divided by EBITDA excluding adjustments for LCM, gain or loss on sale of business and asset write-downs in excess of $10 million in aggregate for the period.

(3) Relative to LYB internal plan for 2025 to current year-end, net of <$50 MM in implementation costs 

"LYB continues to navigate a challenging market environment while remaining focused on delivering long-term value," said Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell chief executive officer. "Our Cash Improvement Plan is on track to achieve our $600 million target in 2025 and a minimum of $1.1 billion by the end of 2026, by reducing fixed costs, managing working capital and optimizing capital investment to strengthen free cash flow. We are prioritizing our investment-grade balance sheet while investing in safe and reliable operations. Our strategy is resilient and we remain confident in our ability to create long-term value for investors."

THIRD QUARTER 2025 RESULTS
The company reported a net loss for the third quarter 2025 of $890 million, or $2.77 per diluted share. During the quarter, the company recognized $1.2 billion of identified items, net of tax. These items, which impacted third-quarter earnings by $3.78 per share, included non-cash asset write-downs, costs incurred for transactions, the Cash Improvement Plan and discontinued operations. Third quarter 2025 EBITDA was $(480) million, or $835 million excluding identified items.

In the Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment, improved profitability was supported by increased olefins margins and higher sales volumes following the successful completion of turnarounds at the company's facility in Channelview, Texas. Polyethylene spreads decreased as monomer costs rose. LYB sales volumes improved on higher domestic demand for polyethylene supported by the company's strong North American market position, along with higher export flows to key global markets. Polypropylene demand remained weak. In Europe, improved operations yielded higher monomer volumes while polymer prices were pressured by increased competition from imports.

In the Intermediates and Derivatives segment, oxyfuels results benefited from increased octane blend premiums, lower butane raw material prices and modestly higher sales volumes, partially offset by declining styrene margins as global supply normalized. In September, LYB started a two-month turnaround at its La Porte, Texas acetyls unit that will position the asset for improved productivity and reliability.

LyondellBasell generated $983 million in cash from operating activities with 135% cash conversion2 during the third quarter. LYB continued to balance capital allocation between capital expenditures of $406 million and $443 million of shareholder returns through dividends. Cash increased and at the end of the quarter, LYB held $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents and maintained $6.5 billion in available liquidity.

STRATEGY HIGHLIGHTS
LYB continues to balance capital allocation between investment in the business and shareholder returns while prioritizing safe and reliable operations. LYB is executing on its priorities and the Cash Improvement Plan remains on track to deliver on a $600 million target for 20253 and a minimum of $1.1 billion by the end of 2026. Capital expenditures will be reduced to $1.2 billion in 2026 by optimizing maintenance spending while supporting the ongoing construction of the company's first chemical recycling plant, MoReTec-1, in Germany. The company took another step in its portfolio transformation with regulatory approvals and the purchase agreement for the sale of four European assets. The company's focus on operational and commercial excellence continues to drive results with the Channelview PO/TBA facility exceeding nameplate operating rates, the Hyperzone polyethylene plant delivering improved performance and the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment leveraging a 75% increase in customer satisfaction relative to 2023 to drive improved business performance.

OUTLOOK
In the fourth quarter, year-end seasonality and lower operating rates are expected to impact results across most businesses. In North America, higher natural gas and feedstock costs are likely to pressure integrated polyolefins margins. In Europe, weak industrial and consumer demand is expected to persist. Global capacity rationalizations and anti-involution measures in China are supporting a more constructive mid-term outlook for the industry. Industry downtime supported oxyfuels margins during October, but seasonally higher costs for feedstocks and lower octane values are expected to pressure oxyfuels profitability for the remainder of the quarter. In Advanced Polymer Solutions, pricing pressures persist, but cost reduction initiatives are expected to offset some of the impact.

In November, LYB will idle its larger cracker in Wesseling, Germany and one of the propylene oxide/styrene monomer units in Channelview, Texas. Each asset will be down for about 40 days. The downtime will allow for maintenance activities while aligning production with global demand and reducing working capital. The company expects fourth-quarter operating rates of 80% for North American olefins and polyolefins (O&P) assets, 60% for European O&P assets and 75% for Intermediates & Derivatives (I&D) assets.

INFORMATION RELATED TO FINANCIAL MEASURES
This release makes reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, but believe that certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA, and EBITDA, net income and diluted EPS exclusive of identified items provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of the company's ongoing operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

We calculate EBITDA as net income (loss) plus interest expense (net), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to profit or operating profit for any period as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to operating cash flows as a measure of our liquidity. We also present EBITDA, net income and diluted EPS exclusive of identified items. Identified items include adjustments for "lower of cost or market" ("LCM"), gain or loss on sale of business, asset write-downs in excess of $10 million in aggregate for the period, Cash Improvement Plan costs, Dutch PO joint venture exit costs, European transaction costs and discontinued operations. Asset write-downs include impairments of goodwill, impairments of long-lived assets, a write-down of a related party loan receivable and a fourth quarter 2024 deferred tax valuation allowance for one of our Chinese joint ventures recognized in Income (loss) from equity investments. Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") inventory valuation methodology, which means that the most recently incurred costs are charged to cost of sales and inventories are valued at the earliest acquisition costs. Fluctuation in the prices of crude oil, natural gas and correlated products from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods, within the same fiscal year as the charge, as market prices recover. A gain or loss on sale of a business is calculated as the consideration received from the sale less its carrying value. We evaluate property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets whenever impairment indicators are present. If it is determined that an asset or asset group's undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized to write the asset down to its estimated fair value. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill is below its carrying amount. If it is determined that the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized. We assess our equity investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. If the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary the investment is written down to its estimated fair value. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In June 2025, we announced plans to sell select olefins & polyolefins assets and the associated business in Europe, resulting in selling expenses, separation costs and employee-related charges (collectively referred to as "transaction costs"). In April 2025, the Company announced the Cash Improvement Plan, focused on strengthening financial performance, which resulted in employee-related charges across all segments. In March 2025, we announced plans to permanently close our Dutch PO joint venture asset, resulting in the recognition of shutdown-related costs. In February 2025, we ceased business operations at our Houston refinery. Accordingly, our refining business, previously disclosed as the Refining segment, is reported as a discontinued operation.

Cash conversion is a measure commonly used by investors to evaluate liquidity. Cash conversion means net cash provided by operating activities divided by EBITDA excluding LCM, gain or loss on sale of business and asset write-downs in excess of $10 million in aggregate for the period. We believe cash conversion is an important financial metric as it helps management and other parties determine how efficiently the company is converting earnings into cash.

These non-GAAP financial measures as presented herein, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way the measures are calculated. In addition, we include calculations for certain other financial measures to facilitate understanding. This release contains time sensitive information that is accurate only as of the time hereof. Information contained in this release is unaudited and subject to change.

LyondellBasell undertakes no obligation to update the information presented herein except to the extent required by law.
