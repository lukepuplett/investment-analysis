ASIA RATIONALIZATION SIGNALING GLOBAL REBALANCING

Expected closures & idling through 2028

Capacity rationalization trends accelerating

Ethylene capacity closures expected to reduce impact of new capacity in China

Announced and anticipated shutdowns represent ~10% of current global supply

Key Points:
• China's anti-involution policies expected to rationalize additional petrochemical overcapacity beyond 6.2 MM t of closures underway
• Europe reductions driven by regulation burdens and structurally high operating costs
• In September, Japan announced capacity closures of ~1.5 MM t
• In August, South Korea announced targeting up to 25% capacity reduction, equivalent to 2.7–3.7 MM t
• Approximately 30% has been announced in the past 12 months
• The domino effect of capacity reductions is accelerating, helping to partly offset new supply from China

Capacity closures by region (MM t):
- Southeast Asia: 2.9 (Closures to date)
- China: ~21.3 (6.2 closures to date, 5.0 announced closures, ~10.1 anticipated closures)
- Europe: ~3.5 (Anticipated closures)
- Japan: ~2.7-3.7 (Announced closures)
- South Korea: ~2.7-3.7 (Announced closures)
- Total: ~30+ MM t

INFORMATION RELATED TO FINANCIAL MEASURES

This presentation makes reference to certain "non-GAAP" financial measures as defined in Regulation G of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We report our financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, but believe that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP measures are as follows:

Cash conversion - Net cash provided by operating activities divided by EBITDA excluding LCM, gain or loss on sale of business and asset write-downs in excess of $10 million in aggregate for the period. This measure is commonly used by investors to evaluate liquidity. We believe cash conversion is an important financial metric as it helps the Company determine how efficiently it is converting its earnings into cash.

EBITDA – Net income (loss) plus interest expense (net), provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. This measure provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of our ongoing operations and is useful for period-over-period comparisons of such operations. EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to profit or operating profit for any period as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to operating cash flows as a measure of our liquidity.

Net debt to EBITDA excluding identified items - Total debt minus cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments divided by EBITDA excluding identified items. This measure is commonly used by investors to evaluate liquidity. We believe that net debt to EBITDA excluding identified items provides useful information to management and other parties in evaluating changes to the Company's capital structure and credit quality.

Trade working capital - Trade working capital equals the sum of accounts receivable and inventory minus accounts payable. Trade working capital cannot be reconciled to working capital due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation including total current assets and total current liabilities, which includes, prepaid expenses, accrued liabilities and other accounts which could be significant.

INFORMATION RELATED TO FINANCIAL MEASURES (CONTINUED)

We also present EBITDA, net income and diluted EPS exclusive of identified items. Identified items include adjustments for "lower of cost or market" ("LCM"), gain or loss on sale of business, asset write-downs in excess of $10 million in aggregate for the period, Cash Improvement Plan costs, Dutch PO joint venture exit costs, European transaction costs and discontinued operations. Asset write-downs include impairments of goodwill, impairments of long-lived assets, a write-down of a related party loan receivable and a fourth quarter 2024 deferred tax valuation allowance for one of our Chinese joint ventures recognized in Income (loss) from equity investments. Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") inventory valuation methodology, which means that the most recently incurred costs are charged to cost of sales and inventories are valued at the earliest acquisition costs. Fluctuation in the prices of crude oil, natural gas and correlated products from period to period may result in the recognition of charges to adjust the value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in periods of falling prices and the reversal of those charges in subsequent interim periods, within the same fiscal year as the charge, as market prices recover. A gain or loss on sale of a business is calculated as the consideration received from the sale less its carrying value. We evaluate property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets whenever impairment indicators are present. If it is determined that an asset or asset group's undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized to write the asset down to its estimated fair value. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill is below its carrying amount. If it is determined that the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized. We assess our equity investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. If the decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In June 2025, we announced plans to sell select olefins & polyolefins assets and the associated business in Europe, resulting in selling expenses, separation costs and employee-related charges (collectively referred to as "transaction costs"). In April 2025, the Company announced the Cash Improvement Plan, focused on strengthening financial performance, which resulted in employee-related charges across all segments. In March 2025, we announced plans to permanently close our Dutch PO joint venture asset, resulting in the recognition of shutdown-related costs. In February 2025, we ceased business operations at our Houston refinery. Accordingly, our refining business, previously disclosed as the Refining segment, is reported as a discontinued operation.

These measures as presented herein, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way the measures are calculated. Reconciliations for our non-GAAP measures can be found on our website at investors.lyondellbasell.com

Additionally, any estimated EBITDA impact is based on estimated production multiplied by estimated margins.
