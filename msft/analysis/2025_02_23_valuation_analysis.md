## Executive Summary (BLUF)

**Microsoft trades at ~11x TTM revenue (~$3.12T market cap, $281.7B TTM revenue) and ~29x TTM P/E, reflecting premium for cloud and AI growth and margin quality. Valuation is full but justified by FCF ($84.5B), capital return, and leading position in enterprise and AI. Base Case fair value ~$420–450/share; Bull Case $500+ on sustained Azure and AI outperformance; Bear Case ~$350 on growth deceleration or regulatory overhang. Key sensitivity: Azure/AI growth and multiple compression if growth slows.**

## Valuation Methodology Overview

| Approach | Fair Value (approx.) | Weight | Key Assumptions |
|----------|----------------------|--------|------------------|
| **Probability-weighted scenarios** | ~$430/share | 50% | Bull/Base/Bear as above |
| **DCF (Base Case)** | ~$440/share | 25% | 9% WACC; 6% terminal growth; FY26E revenue ~$318B |
| **EV/Revenue (Base)** | ~$435/share | 25% | 10.5x FY26E revenue |
| **Blended** | **~$432/share** | 100% | Slight discount to current if trading ~$420 |

## Recommendation
- **Current view:** Fair to slight undervaluation vs Base Case (~$430).
- **Action:** Hold; add on 10–15% pullbacks or on confirmation of Azure/AI acceleration.
- **Downside trigger:** Azure growth <20% for 2+ quarters or material regulatory remedy.
