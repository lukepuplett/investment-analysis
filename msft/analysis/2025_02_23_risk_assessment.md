## Executive Summary (BLUF)

**Microsoft’s main risks are (1) cloud/AI competitive pressure from AWS and Google (severity 7/10, mitigant 7/10—strong enterprise position and AI monetization), (2) regulatory and antitrust scrutiny (severity 7/10, mitigant 6/10—size and acquisitions draw attention), and (3) capital intensity and ROI of AI/datacenter spend (severity 6/10, mitigant 7/10—strong FCF and margins). No open red flags with severity ≥8 and mitigant ≤5. Balance sheet is strong; execution and competitive positioning are the primary focus.**
