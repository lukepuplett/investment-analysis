## Key Risks and Concerns

### Financial Risks

1. **High Leverage**: Debt/equity ratio of 170% creates interest rate sensitivity
2. **Negative Free Cash Flow**: Heavy capital investment requires ongoing financing
3. **Regulatory Lag**: Rate case timing can impact cash flow recovery
4. **Execution Risk**: Large capital plan requires successful project execution

### Mitigating Factors

1. **Strong Cash Generation**: Robust operating cash flow supports debt service
2. **Credit Improvement**: Strategic transactions strengthen balance sheet
3. **Regulatory Support**: Constructive regulatory outcomes across jurisdictions
4. **Diversified Portfolio**: Multiple jurisdictions reduce regulatory risk

## Conclusion

Duke Energy demonstrates strong financial fundamentals with consistent revenue growth, improving profitability margins, and robust cash generation. The company's strategic asset transactions (Brookfield investment in Florida, Piedmont TN sale) materially strengthen the credit profile while enabling continued capital investment. While high leverage and negative free cash flow are concerns typical of growth utilities, the company's strong regulatory positioning, diversified service territories, and execution track record support continued financial performance. The reaffirmed 5-7% EPS growth target through 2029, combined with an attractive dividend yield (~3.4%), provides a compelling risk-adjusted return profile for income-focused investors.
