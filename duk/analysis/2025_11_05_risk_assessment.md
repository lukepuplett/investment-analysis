# Duke Energy Corporation (DUK) – Risk Assessment

**Date:** November 5, 2025

## Executive Summary

**BLUF: Duke Energy faces moderate risks typical of regulated utilities, including regulatory outcomes, execution of large capital projects, high leverage (170% debt/equity), and weather-related events. Key mitigants include diversified jurisdictions reducing single-regulator risk, strong regulatory relationships, proven execution track record, and strategic transactions strengthening credit profile. Nuclear operations, environmental compliance, and load growth uncertainty present additional risks. Overall risk profile is MODERATE with strong mitigants, appropriate for income-focused investors seeking stable utility exposure with growth potential.**
