Duke Energy reports second-quarter 2025 financial results
▪ Second-quarter 2025 reported and adjusted EPS of $1.25
▪ Strong first half performance puts the company on track to deliver full year
results within guidance range
▪ Transaction proceeds support material strengthening of company's credit profile
and higher capital deployment at Duke Energy Florida
CHARLOTTE, N.C. – Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) today announced second-quarter 2025
reported EPS, prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP),
and adjusted EPS of $1.25. This is compared to reported EPS of $1.13 and adjusted EPS of
$1.18 for the second quarter of 2024. Adjusted EPS excludes the impact of certain items that
are included in reported EPS.
Higher second-quarter 2025 adjusted results were driven by the implementation of new rates
and riders, partially offset by higher O&M expenses and interest expense.
The company is reaffirming its 2025 adjusted EPS guidance range of $6.17 to $6.42 and longterm adjusted EPS growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2029 off the 2025 midpoint of $6.30.
Management does not forecast reported GAAP EPS and related long-term growth rates.
"We've had a strong start to the year, executing on our strategic priorities of advancing largescale economic development projects, securing industry-leading regulatory and legislative
outcomes, and strengthening the balance sheet," said Harry Sideris, Duke Energy president
and chief executive officer. "To position the company for the significant growth ahead, we
recently announced two strategic transactions – an equity investment in Duke Energy Florida
and the sale of our Piedmont Tennessee business. These efficient funding sources at
compelling valuations materially strengthen our credit profile and help fund the increasing
investments needed to meet unprecedented growth over the next decade."

Gas Utilities and Infrastructure
On a reported and adjusted basis, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure recognized second-quarter
2025 segment income of $6 million, compared to reported and adjusted segment income of $6
million in the second quarter of 2024. Flat quarterly results were primarily due to growth from
rate increases and riders, offset by higher O&M expenses and depreciation on a growing asset
base.

corporate costs and results from Duke Energy's captive insurance company.

tax expense.
