## Executive Summary

**BLUF: Virgin Galactic shows improved cost management but remains in a critical pre-revenue phase with significant cash burn. The company has $190M in presold tickets providing revenue visibility, but faces a 16+ month gap without flights until 2026 commercial launch. Asset value of $1.11B vs $233M market cap suggests 79% undervaluation, but execution risk remains high.**

The company achieved a 34% reduction in operating expenses and improved adjusted EBITDA, though revenue declined due to the strategic pause in commercial flights to focus on spaceship production.
