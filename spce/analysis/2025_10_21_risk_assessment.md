# Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (SPCE) - Risk Assessment

**Analysis Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Data Period:** Q2 2025 Results and Risk Factors  
**Analyst:** Investment Analysis Framework

## Executive Summary

**BLUF: Virgin Galactic faces HIGH RISK across all dimensions. Critical concerns: $131.4M quarterly cash burn, 16+ month flight gap (last flight June 2024), 2026 commercial launch dependency, and 37% dilution. While $508M cash provides runway and $190M presold tickets show demand, execution risk is extreme. Only suitable for high-risk tolerance investors.**

Virgin Galactic faces significant risks across multiple dimensions, with financial sustainability being the most critical concern. The company's $114M quarterly cash burn, 37% dilution from recent equity offerings, and delayed commercial timeline create substantial execution risk. While technical progress is encouraging, the combination of high cash burn, market uncertainty, and competitive pressures requires careful risk management and monitoring.

### Key Risk Categories
- **Financial Risks:** High cash burn, dilution, liquidity concerns
- **Technical Risks:** Production delays, manufacturing challenges, certification timeline
- **Market Risks:** Unproven demand, economic sensitivity, competition
- **Operational Risks:** Timeline execution, scaling challenges, regulatory compliance
- **Strategic Risks:** Government program uncertainty, international expansion
