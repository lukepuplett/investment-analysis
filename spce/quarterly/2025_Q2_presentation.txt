This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor
provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”). All statements contained in this presentation other than statements of historical fact, including, without limitation, statements regarding our spaceflight systems, scaling of our future fleet, increasing
our flight rate, providing repeatable and reliable access to space, development of our spaceships and proposed timeline for assembling, testing and commercial service using such spaceships, the potential to
develop additional spaceships in the future and the anticipated costs thereof, our commercial initiatives, including our plans for reopening sales, potential opportunities for our carrier platform, our potential to raise
growth capital and the sources thereof, the timing of the design process, tooling development, parts fabrication and assembly of our spaceships, expansion plans for a second spaceport and additional spaceports
around the world, and our objectives for future operations, growth plans and profitability and the Company’s financial forecasts, including expected free cash flow, potential annualized revenues and adjusted
EBITDA and contribution margin, are forward-looking statements. The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “potential,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “strategy,” “future,” “could,” “would,” “project,”
“plan,” “target,” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, though not all forward-looking statements use these words or expressions. These statements are neither promises nor
guarantees, but involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including but not limited to any delay in future commercial flights of our spaceflight fleet, our ability to successfully develop and
test our next generation vehicles, and the time and costs associated with doing so, our expected capital requirements and the availability of additional financing, and the other factors, risks and uncertainties included
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, as such factors may be updated from time to time in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"),
accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and the Investor Relations section of our website at www.virgingalactic.com, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the
forward-looking statements made in this presentation. Any such forward-looking statements represent management’s estimates as of the date of this presentation. While we may elect to update such forward-looking
statements at some point in the future, we disclaim any obligation to do so, even if subsequent events cause our views to change.
USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
This presentation references certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), including, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash
flow. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and certain other items the Company believes are not
indicative of its core operating performance. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. None of these non-GAAP financial measures is a substitute
for or superior to measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP.
The Company believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors about the Company in understanding and evaluating its operating results,
enhancing the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by its management in financial and operationaldecision making. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP measures and their nearest GAAP equivalents. For example, other companies may calculate non-GAAP measures
differently, or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance, and therefore any non-GAAP measures the Company uses may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies.
A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is included in the appendix to this presentation.
The Company also provides certain non-GAAP measures, including free cash flow, on a forward-looking basis. The Company has not provided a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to
the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because such a reconciliation is not available without unreasonable efforts, due to the variability of these items and the fact that there is substantial
uncertainty associated with predicting any future adjustments that we may make to our GAAP financial measures in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures.

FINANCIAL RESULTS
• Revenue of $0.4 million, compared to $4.2 million in the prior year period, with the
decrease driven by the pause in commercial spaceflights to focus efforts on the
production of our new SpaceShips.
• Total operating expenses were $70 million, compared to $106 million in the prior year
period. This reflects a shift from R&D to capital investments in manufacturing assets and
the production of our SpaceShips, as well as a reduction in overall cost structure.
• Net loss of $67 million, compared to net loss of $94 million in the prior year period, with
the improvement primarily driven by lower operating expenses.
• Adjusted EBITDA of $(52) million, compared to $(79) million in the prior year period.
• Free cash flow of $(114) million in each of the second quarters of 2025 and 2024.
• Raised $56 million in gross proceeds as part of the at-the-market equity offering
program.
