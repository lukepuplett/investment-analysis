(1) Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries ("Virgin Galactic" or the "Company"), is an aerospace and space travel
company focused on the development, manufacture and operation of spaceships and related technologies. The Company provides access to space for
private individuals, researchers and government agencies. The Company's missions include flying passengers to space, as well as flying scientific
payloads and researchers to space in order to conduct experiments for scientific and educational purposes.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission for interim financial reporting. Certain information and footnote disclosures, normally included in annual consolidated
financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), have been condensed or omitted pursuant
to such rules and regulations. However, in management's opinion, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, including
those of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present fairly the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
presented.
The operating results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire
fiscal year. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. There have been no changes to the
significant accounting policies presented in the audited consolidated financial statements contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K that would
have a material impact on the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
(2) Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
The Company maintains certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Restricted cash consists of cash deposits received from future
astronauts that are contractually restricted for operational use until the condition of carriage is signed or the deposits are refunded.
The amortized cost, unrealized gain (loss) and estimated fair value of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are as follows:

Equity Incentive Plans
The Company maintains two equity incentive plans -- the Third Amended and Restated Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. 2019 Incentive Award Plan (the
"Third A&R Plan") and the Amended and Restated Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. 2023 Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plan (the "A&R
Inducement Plan").
The Third A&R Plan was adopted by the Company's board of directors in April 2025, subject to the approval of the Company’s stockholders, and
became effective upon the approval of the Company’s stockholders in June 2025. The Third A&R Plan amended and restated the Second Amended
and Restated Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. 2019 Incentive Plan (the “Second A&R Plan”) and made the following material changes to the Second
A&R Plan: (i) increased the number of shares available by 5.5 million shares to an aggregate of 7,670,437 shares reserved for issuance under the Third
A&R Plan, (ii) increased the number of shares which may be granted as incentive stock options (“ISOs”) under the Third A&R Plan, such that an
aggregate of 7,670,437 shares may be granted as ISOs under the Third A&R Plan, and (iii) extended the right to grant awards under the Third A&R
Plan through June 5, 2035, provided that ISOs may not be granted under the Third A&R Plan after April 10, 2035.
The A&R Inducement Plan was adopted by the Company's board of directors and became effective in June 2025. The A&R Inducement Plan
increased the number of shares available by 1.0 million shares to an aggregate of 1,140,000 shares reserved for issuance under the A&R Inducement
Plan.
Pursuant to the Third A&R Plan and related predecessor plans, the Company has granted equity incentive awards, including time-based stock options,
performance-based stock options ("PSOs"), restricted stock units ("RSUs"), and performance stock units ("PSUs"). Pursuant to the A&R Inducement
Plan, and its predecessor plan, the Company has granted RSUs.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. 2025 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") was adopted by the Company's board of directors in April 2025,
subject to the approval of the Company's stockholders, and became effective upon the approval of the Company's stockholders in June 2025. The
aggregate number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the ESPP is 2.5 million. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an "employee
stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section 423(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the ESPP, eligible employees of the Company and its
designated subsidiaries who elect to participate are granted an option to purchase common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the
common stock on either the first day of the six-month offering period or on the applicable purchase date, unless otherwise determined by the plan
administrator. The ESPP permits participating employees to make contributions to purchase shares of common stock, in an amount between 1% and
15% of eligible compensation (unless otherwise determined by the plan administrator), subject to limits specified in the plan document and the
Internal Revenue Code.
The initial six-month offering period of the ESPP commenced on July 1, 2025.

liability-classified awards 91 144 27 343
Stock-based compensation expense for equityclassified awards $ 4,741 $ 8,092 $ 9,574 $ 16,137
As of June 30, 2025, the Company had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $0.3 million for stock options, which is expected to be
recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.5 years. Unrecognized stock-based compensation expense as of June 30, 2025 for RSUs and PSUs
totaled $29.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively, which are expected to be recognized over weighted-average periods of 2.3 years and 0.8 years,
respectively.
(9) Income Taxes
Income tax expense (benefit) was $(37,000) and $34,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Income tax expense was
$11,000 and $114,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The effective income tax rate was nil for each of the three and
six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a full valuation allowance against
net deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

(10) Earnings Per Share
The following table presents net loss per share and related information:
Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,
2025 2024 2025 2024
(In thousands, except per share amounts)
Basic and diluted:
Net loss $ (67,280) $ (93,775) $ (151,767) $ (195,787)
Weighted-average common shares outstanding 45,641 21,484 40,569 20,752
Basic and diluted net loss per share $ (1.47) $ (4.36) $ (3.74) $ (9.43)
Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The
computation of diluted net loss per share excludes the effect of all potential common shares outstanding as their impact would have been anti-dilutive.
The Company has excluded stock-based awards and shares issuable upon conversion of the 2027 Notes from the diluted loss per share calculation
because their effect was anti-dilutive. The total number of shares excluded for each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 was 7.3 million.
The total number of shares excluded for each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 was 2.4 million.
(11) Fair Value Measurements
Assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements are required to be disclosed within a fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy ranks the
quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair value. Accordingly, assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified within the
fair value hierarchy in one of the following categories:
• Level 1 inputs — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2 inputs — Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of
the asset or liability.
• Level 3 inputs — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the asset or
liability.
The following tables present the Company's financial assets that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, segregated among the appropriate
levels within the fair value hierarchy:

Legal Proceedings
From time to time, the Company is a party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The
Company applies accounting for contingencies to determine when and how much to accrue for and disclose related to legal and other contingencies.
Accordingly, the Company discloses contingencies deemed to be reasonably possible and accrues loss contingencies when, in consultation with legal
advisors, it is concluded that a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Although the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial
impact with respect to these matters is subject to many uncertainties and is therefore not predictable with assurance, management believes that any
monetary liability or financial impact to the Company from these matters, individually and in the aggregate, beyond that provided at June 30, 2025,
would not be material to the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance with
respect to such result, and monetary liability or financial impact to the Company from legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims could differ
materially from those projected.
Lavin v. the Company
On May 28, 2021, a putative class action complaint was filed against the Company in the Eastern District of New York captioned Lavin v. Virgin
Galactic Holdings, Inc. ("Lavin Action"), Case No. 1:21-cv-03070. In September 2021, the Court appointed Robert Scheele and Mark Kusnier as colead plaintiffs for the purported class. Co-lead plaintiffs amended the complaint in December 2021, asserting violations of Sections 10(b), 20(a) and
20A of the Exchange Act of 1934 against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors on behalf of a putative class of
investors who purchased the Company's common stock between July 10, 2019 and October 14, 2021.
The amended complaint alleged, among other things, that the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors made false and
misleading statements and failed to disclose certain information regarding the safety of the Company's ships and success of its commercial flight
program. Co-lead plaintiffs seek damages, interest, costs, expenses, attorneys' fees, and other unspecified equitable relief. The defendants moved to
dismiss the amended complaint and, on November 7, 2022, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion and gave the plaintiffs
leave to file a further amended complaint.

which has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025. Pursuant to the MOU, the Company has agreed to pay $8.5 million, of which
approximately $5.6 million is expected to be covered and paid directly by the Company’s insurers pursuant to insurance policies. During the three
months ended June 30, 2025, the Company accrued a liability for the gross settlement amount and also recorded a receivable for the portion of the
settlement that is expected to be covered directly by insurance. The Parties are currently working on the final settlement agreement to submit to the
Court for final approval and the Company expects to make all payments by the end of 2025.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to the “Company,” "Virgin Galactic," “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Virgin Galactic
Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the condensed consolidated financial
statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as the audited financial statements and the related notes
thereto, and the discussion under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business” included in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 (the "Annual Report on Form 10-K"). This discussion contains forward-looking
statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth under the “Risk
Factors” sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 and under the "Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" section and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our actual results may dif er materially from
those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
Overview
We are an aerospace and space travel company offering access to space for private individuals, researchers and government agencies. Our missions include
flying passengers to space, as well as flying scientific payloads and researchers to space in order to conduct experiments for scientific and educational
purposes. Our operations include the design and development, manufacturing, ground and flight testing, spaceflight operation, and post-flight maintenance of
our spaceflight system. Our spaceflight system was developed using our proprietary technology and processes and is focused on providing space travel
experiences for private astronauts, researcher flights and professional astronaut training. We have also leveraged our knowledge and expertise in manufacturing
spaceships to occasionally perform engineering services for third parties. To expand capacity, we are currently developing our next-generation spaceflight
vehicles. These next-generation spaceflight vehicles, which include our Delta Class spaceships and additional launch vehicles, are expected to dramatically
increase our annual flight rate. Following the completion of the non-recurring engineering work on our Delta Class spaceships, we have redeployed
engineering resources to the next phase of design for our next-generation launch vehicle. In addition, we are exploring the opportunity to use a derivative
model of our launch vehicle as a High-Altitude, Long-Endurance ("HALE") aircraft, which we believe could be utilized for several types of government and
research purposes.
Recent Developments
The development of our new Delta Class spaceships is on track. We are progressing through our build milestones with key tools and materials continuing to
arrive at our spaceship final assembly facility. Commercial service remains planned for 2026, with both research and private astronaut flights expected in the
fall of 2026.
On July 18, 2025, plaintiffs and defendants executed a Memorandum of Understanding outlining the terms of a settlement to resolve all claims in the putative
class action complaint filed against us in the action entitled Lavin v. Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (“Lavin Action”). See Note 12 to our condensed
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. We are currently working on the final
settlement agreement to submit to the Court for final approval and expect to make all payments by the end of 2025.
Factors Affecting Our Performance
We believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and
challenges, including those discussed below and in Part 1, Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K titled “Risk Factors” and in Part II, Item 1A. of our
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.
Customer Demand
We have already received significant interest from potential astronauts. Going forward, we expect the size of our backlog and the number of astronauts that
have flown to space on our spaceflight system to be an important indicator of our future performance. Our sales remain paused, but we expect to open tranches
of sales reservations in the first quarter of 2026 as we approach the start of commercial service. As of June 30, 2025, we have reservations for spaceflights for
approximately 675 future astronauts, which represent approximately $190 million in expected future spaceflight revenue upon completion of the spaceflights.

Table of Contents
Safety Performance of Our Spaceflight Systems
Our spaceflight systems are highly specialized with sophisticated and complex technology. We have built operational processes to ensure that the design,
manufacture, performance and service of our spaceflight systems meet rigorous quality standards. However, our spaceflight systems are still subject to
operational and process risks, such as manufacturing and design issues, human errors, or cyber-attacks. Any actual or perceived safety issues may result in
significant reputational harm to our business and our ability to generate spaceflight revenue.

research, applied research, concept formulation studies, design, development, and related testing activities. Research and development costs consist primarily
of equipment, material, and labor costs (including from third-party contractors) for designing the spaceflight system’s structure, spaceflight propulsion system,
and flight profiles for our next-generation spaceships and launch vehicles, as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs.
Research and development expenses decreased from $41.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 to $20.1 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2025. The decrease was primarily driven by a $19.2 million decrease in sub-contractor and contract labor costs associated with the development of our

Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $3.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 to $4.2 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2025. Depreciation and amortization expense increased from $7.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 to $8.4 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2025. The increases were primarily due to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment.
Interest Income
Interest income decreased from $11.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 to $5.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2025. Interest
income decreased from $23.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 to $13.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025. These decreases were
primarily driven by decreased average balances of marketable securities and deposits in interest-bearing accounts.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $3.2 million for each of the three months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. Interest expense was $6.5 million for each of the six months
ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. Interest expense primarily consists of interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs related to our convertible senior
notes.
Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
Income tax expense (benefit) was immaterial for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. We have accumulated net operating losses at the U.S.
federal and state levels. We maintain a full valuation allowance against our net U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. The income tax expense (benefit) is
primarily related to corporate income taxes for our operations in the United Kingdom, which operates on a cost-plus arrangement.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of June 30, 2025, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $193.7 million and total marketable securities of $314.0 million. Our principal
sources of liquidity have come from sales of our common stock and offering of convertible senior notes ("2027 Notes").

Financing Activities
Net cash provided by financing activities was $83.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025, and consisted primarily of net cash proceeds from the sale
and issuance of common stock pursuant to our at-the-market offering program.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $69.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, and consisted primarily of net cash proceeds from the sale
and issuance of common stock pursuant to our at-the-market offering program.
Funding Requirements
We expect our expenditures to fluctuate in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue to advance the development of our nextgeneration spaceflight system and leverage investments in capital expenditures.
As our fleet of spaceships expands, we expect our expenditures to increase as we scale our commercial operations. Specifically, our long-term expenditures
will increase as we:
• scale up our manufacturing processes and capabilities to support expanding our fleet with additional spaceships, launch vehicles and rocket motors in
connection with commercialization;
• hire additional personnel in manufacturing operations, testing programs, maintenance operations and guest services as we increase the volume of our
spaceflights; and
• scale up required operational facilities, such as hangars and warehouses.
We expect our arrangements with third-party providers to manufacture key subassemblies for our next-generation spaceships and for the design and
manufacture of our next-generation launch vehicles will require significant capital expenditures. Certain estimated amounts in connection with third-party
arrangements are subject to future negotiations and cannot be estimated with reasonable certainty.
We believe that our current capital is adequate to sustain our operations for at least the next twelve months. Changing circumstances may cause us to consume
capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our
control. While we have completed our initial commercial launch with a single spaceship, we are currently developing our next-generation spaceflight vehicles.
We anticipate the costs to manufacture additional vehicles will begin to decrease as we continue to scale up our manufacturing processes and capabilities.
Issuances of Common Stock
In June 2023, we entered into a distribution agency agreement with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Goldman Sachs &
Co. LLC (each, an "Agent" and collectively, the "Agents") providing for the offer and sale of up to $400 million of shares of our common stock from time to
time through the Agents, acting as sales agents, or directly to one or more of the Agents, acting as principal(s), through an "at-the-market offering" program
(the "2023 ATM Program").
In November 2024, we terminated the 2023 ATM Program, having sold a total of 12.8 million shares of common stock and generating $396.2 million in gross
proceeds, before deducting $3.9 million in underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses.
26
Table of Contents
In November 2024, we entered into an open market sale agreement with Jefferies LLC ("Jefferies") providing for the offer and sale of up to $300 million of
shares of our common stock from time to time through Jefferies, acting as sales agent, or directly to Jefferies, acting as principal, through an "at-the-market
offering" program (the "2024 ATM Program").
During the six months ended June 30, 2025, we sold 22.7 million shares of common stock under the 2024 ATM Program and generated $86.3 million in gross
proceeds, before deducting $2.6 million in underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses.
As of June 30, 2025, we sold a total of 26.8 million shares of common stock under the 2024 ATM Program, generating $115.4 million in gross proceeds since
its inception, before deducting $3.4 million in underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses.
Liquidity Outlook
For at least the next twelve months, we expect our principal demand for funds will be for our ongoing activities described above. We expect to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements primarily through our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand. We believe we will have sufficient liquidity
available to fund our business needs, commitments and contractual obligations for the next twelve months.
Beyond the next twelve months, our principal demand for funds will be to sustain our operations, operate our spaceline at Spaceport America in New Mexico,
and expand our fleet of spaceships, launch vehicles, and supporting facilities. We expect to generate revenue from our spaceflight program, which is expected
to restart in 2026. To the extent this source of capital as well as sources of capital described above are insufficient to meet our needs, we may need to seek
additional debt or equity financing.
The commercial launch of our spaceflight program and the anticipated expansion of our fleet have unpredictable costs and are subject to significant risks,
uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, that may affect the timing and magnitude of these anticipated expenditures. Some of
these risk and uncertainties are described in more detail in our Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Business.”
Contractual Obligations and Commitments
Except as set forth in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been
no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations and commitments as described in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses
and related disclosures. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies referred to below have the greatest
potential impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and, therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Accordingly, we
evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
During the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2025, there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates compared to those previously
disclosed in "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" included in Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" included in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Not applicable for smaller reporting companies.

Table of Contents
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), management
recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required
to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended June 30, 2025 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
We are from time to time subject to various lawsuits, claims and other legal and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of
these lawsuits, claims and other proceedings may involve highly complex issues that are subject to substantial uncertainties, and could result in damages, fines,
penalties, non-monetary sanctions or relief. However, we do not consider any such lawsuits, claims or proceedings that are currently pending, individually or in
the aggregate, to be material to our business or likely to result in a material adverse effect on our future operating results, financial condition or cash flows. See
Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited
to those described as risk factors, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual operating results and financial condition to vary
materially from past, or anticipated future, operating results and financial condition. For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, see the risk factors
previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1. “Business,” Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” and Part II, Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, in Part II, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended March 31, 2025 and in Part I, Item 2. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.

to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
b. any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s internal control over
financial reporting.
