Virgin Galactic Announces Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results and Provides Business Update
August 6, 2025
Commercial Service Planned for 2026 with Private Astronaut Spaceflight Remaining On Track for Fall 2026
Progress on SpaceShips Continues Across All Systems and Structures
ORANGE COUNTY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Virgin Galactic Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: SPCE) (“Virgin Galactic” or the "Company”) today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025 and provided a business update.

Michael Colglazier, Chief Executive Officer of Virgin Galactic said, "Progress on our SpaceShips continues across all systems and structures, and our strong balance sheet, with over $500 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, provides the foundation to execute our business model as we bring our SpaceShips into commercial service. We have continued to reduce our quarterly cash spending and operating expense as part of our disciplined approach. Commercial service remains planned for 2026, with both research and private astronaut flights expected in the fall next year."

Second Quarter 2025 Financial Highlights

Cash position remains strong, with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $508 million as of June 30, 2025.
Revenue of $0.4 million, compared to $4.2 million in the second quarter of 2024, with the decrease driven by the pause in commercial spaceflights to focus efforts on the production of the Delta Class SpaceShips.
GAAP total operating expenses of $70 million, compared to $106 million in the second quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP total operating expenses of $58 million in the second quarter of 2025, compared to $95 million in the second quarter of 2024.
Net loss of $67 million, compared to a $94 million net loss in the second quarter of 2024, with the improvement primarily driven by lower operating expenses.
Adjusted EBITDA totaled $(52) million, compared to $(79) million in the second quarter of 2024, primarily driven by lower operating expenses.
Net cash used in operating activities totaled $55 million, compared to $79 million in the second quarter of 2024.
Cash paid for capital expenditures totaled $58 million, compared to $34 million in the second quarter of 2024.
Free cash flow totaled $(114) million in each of the second quarters of 2025 and 2024.
Generated $56 million in gross proceeds through the issuance of 15.7 million shares of common stock as part of the Company's at-the-market offering programs.
Business Updates

SpaceShip fuselage expected to be completed late Q4 2025 or early Q1 2026.
Commercial spaceflight continues to track for 2026, with both research and private astronaut flights expected to commence in the fall of 2026.
Financial Guidance

The following forward-looking statements reflect our expectations for the third quarter of 2025 as of August 6, 2025 and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date, but may be materially affected by many factors, as discussed below in “Forward-Looking Statements.”

Free cash flow for the third quarter of 2025 is expected to be in the range of $(100) million to $(110) million.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to the Company's results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), the Company is also providing certain non-GAAP financial measures. A discussion regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP information is presented later in this press release.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release references certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including non-GAAP total operating expenses, Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. The Company defines non-GAAP total operating expenses as total operating expenses other than stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, and accrued legal settlement expense. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and accrued legal settlement expense. The Company defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. None of these non-GAAP financial measures is a substitute for or superior to measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP.

The Company believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors about the Company in understanding and evaluating its operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by its management in financial and operational-decision making. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP measures and their nearest GAAP equivalents. For example, other companies may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance, and therefore any non-GAAP measures the Company uses may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

A reconciliation of total operating expenses to non-GAAP total operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, is set forth below (in thousands):

The Company has not provided a reconciliation of forward-looking free cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because such a reconciliation is not available without unreasonable efforts, due to the variability of these items and the fact that there is substantial uncertainty associated with predicting any future adjustments that we may make to our GAAP financial measures in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures.
