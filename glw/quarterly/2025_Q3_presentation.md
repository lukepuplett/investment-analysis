  - Hedge contracts settled in any given quarter substantially offset changes in earnings and cash flow due to currency fluctuations
- Recorded non-cash, after-tax gain of $4M on the translation of foreign denominated debt

## Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)

At Corning Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is calculated based on the Core performance.

**ROIC Definition:**

**Numerator = Return (Operating Income Tax Adjusted)**
- Operating Income
- + Equity in earnings of affiliated companies
- – Tax
- = Operating Income Tax Adjusted

**Denominator = Invested Capital**
- Equity
- + Long and Short term Debt
- = Invested Capital

**ROIC = Operating Income Tax Adjusted (Return) / Equity+Debt (Invested Capital)**

## Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information

Corning has included non-GAAP financial measures in this presentation to supplement Corning's consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis.

In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we adjust certain measures included in our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to arrive at measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and exclude specific items that are non-recurring, related to foreign exchange volatility, or unrelated to continuing operations. These measures are our core performance measures.

Management uses core performance measures, along with GAAP financial measures, to make financial and operational decisions and certain of these measures also form the basis of our compensation program metrics. Management believes that our core performance measures are indicative of our core operating performance and provide investors with greater visibility into how management evaluates our results and trends and makes business decisions. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for, GAAP reporting measures.

Items that are excluded from certain core performance calculations include: the impact of translating the foreign denominated debt, the impact of the translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments, restructuring, impairment and other charges and credits, certain litigation, regulatory and other legal matters, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect the ongoing operating results of the Company.

In addition, because a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management believes it is important to understand the impact on sales and net income of translating these currencies into U.S. dollars. Therefore, management utilizes constant-currency reporting for the Optical Communications, Display, Specialty Materials, Automotive and Life Sciences segments to exclude the impact from the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, New Taiwan dollar, Mexican peso and euro, as applicable to the segment. The most significant constant-currency adjustment relates to the Japanese yen exposure within the Display segment. The constant-currency rates established for our core performance measures are long-term management-determined rates, which are closely aligned with our hedging instrument rates. These hedging instruments may include, but are not limited to, foreign exchange forward or option contracts and foreign-denominated debt.

For details of the rates used, refer to the footnotes to the "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures" section. We believe that the use of constant-currency reporting allows management to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations, analyze underlying trends in the businesses and establish operational goals and forecasts.

With respect to the outlook for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because management does not forecast the movement of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of management's control. As a result, management is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.
