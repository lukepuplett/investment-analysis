## Q&A Session

### Question 1: Joshua Spector (UBS) - Optical Sales Timing

**Question:** I just wanted to ask on the optical sales. Obviously, a good quarter and good growth year over year. I think expectations are maybe a little bit higher based on some other kind of optical sales players into that supply chain. I'm just curious if you could talk about any timing effects between 3Q, 4Q that may have impacted some sales or if this is kind of the right run rate we should be growing off of.

**Ed Schlesinger:** Our data center business was about $1.3 billion in 2023, and our current run rate is about $3.3 billion. We've added $2 billion of sales in that space over about seven quarters, a significant amount of growth. We expect that growth to continue. We also have a reasonable amount of growth that's accelerating in the Data Center Interconnect space, and that's in our carrier business. We also grew carrier about 14% in the third quarter year over year, significant growth there as well. I think we think of that as significantly outperforming hyperscale CapEx. We would size that, if you use Dell'Oro or some of the other firms that publish, at about a 40% year-over-year level. That's not sort of how we think about that business. The timing in any given quarter certainly can depend on specific customer plans.

**Wendell Weeks:** We do timing from quarter-to-quarter. Best served there, I think to maybe follow up after the call with Ann, and let's make sure that sort of how you're thinking about models and what's happening in a quarter, any given quarter is one place for us just to start so we make sure we don't talk past each other. What I'd add is sort of every time we're in a conversation with our customers, they want more from us. Things are quite tight right now. That being said, the reaction to our products is such that they want us to grow even more dramatically as they look ahead to the needs of their supply chain. And so really, in the dialogues between ourselves and our customers, where they've really turned to is if we need to grow our capacity faster than we currently are. How can they step forward to de-risk any capital that we have to invest? The way we look at this is the growth rates are just so high. As we seek to serve and delight our customers, we look to them to be able to help us with any sort of capacity investment and/or de-risk that capital investment going forward for our shareholders.

### Question 2: Asiya Merchant (Citi) - Operating Margin Expansion

**Question:** Really powerful operating margin expansion growth here, guided as well for 4Q. How should we think about now, given the growth that you guys are talking about, whether it's in Optical, auto, solar ramp, how should we think about incremental operating margins going beyond this fourth quarter here? If there are any updates now to the Springboard operating margin target, given you're already achieving that a quarter ahead, sorry, almost a year ahead in 4Q.

**Ed Schlesinger:** First of all, we're really pleased with the performance we've had over the last seven quarters. I think improving both our gross margin and our operating margin was a really key component of our Springboard plan. We feel great about where we are. As I mentioned in our guide, for both Q3 and Q4, we had some ramp costs associated with bringing our solar facility online. At some point, those costs will go away. We'll be producing at full capacity and selling, and that'll help with our gross margin and our operating margin as well. The way I think for now that we'd like you to think about our operating margin is it creates a really strong return profile for our business. We expect sales to continue to grow nicely as we go forward. We've got a 20% operating margin. Certainly could go higher than that. We'll come back and address that at some point later in the future. If we're able to continue to grow our sales at that level, we'll continue to improve our return on invested capital, and we'll continue to improve our free cash flow.

**Question:** Maybe on auto, how you guys are thinking about the upcoming emissions, whether it's a 2026 driver and the growth rates we should expect in that segment.

**Ed Schlesinger:** In auto right now, one thing I would point out is that our sales are impacted by a weaker heavy-duty market in North America. At some point, that will bottom out and start to come back, and we'll start to see the growth we would expect, like in our Automotive Glass segment and in maybe other parts of the business. We'll see that live through just because heavy-duty will sort of stabilize and start to come back through the cycle. Yes, we do expect a couple of drivers of growth in this business. First, Automotive Glass. We expect that business to continue to grow and drive growth through this year into next year and so on. I think the emissions regulations in the U.S. could start to impact us at the end of 2026 for model years that start in 2027 and beyond.

### Question 3: John Roberts (Mizuho) - Solar Inventory Impact

**Question:** In solar, I think there was a large amount of downstream cell and panel inventory brought into the U.S. in advance of the new duties. Does that impact your ramp at all, or do you accelerate as those downstream inventories are worked off?

**Wendell Weeks:** You are correct, that was indeed true. As those inventories deplete, we're seeing really two impacts: a demand front and as well, sort of module pricing continuing to improve. Yeah, we're seeing the dynamics that you're talking about. The core of our particular play is the need for U.S. origin product. As a result, most of our customers are signing up to us just for that. Really, on the margin, the particular overall industry dynamics that you're explaining don't hit us that dramatically because we're a preferred supplier as a U.S. player.

### Question 4: Joe Cardoso (JPMorgan) - Optical Margins

**Question:** Optical is clearly demonstrating strong revenue performance in the backdrop of these AI tailwinds. Margins have also been impressive, tracking close to 18% in the quarter. How should we think about the headroom for margins to continue to improve from here? As you consider kind of the demand pipeline that you're seeing from your customers, how should we think about factors such as product mix, as well as eventually capacity additions that could influence the trajectory here?

**Wendell Weeks:** Everything really comes down to the reaction to our innovations and the value they create. As our innovations create more and more value, it offers us the opportunity to continue to improve our profitability. As well, we see the opportunity for continued growth here to be quite robust tied to those new product sets. We'll provide a little more insight as we get a little bit further along in our customer dialogues with how we're going to approach capacity, risk reduction, and strong commitments from our customers that will allow us to provide high-confidence guidance for our investors.

**Ed Schlesinger:** As we've shared the last several quarters, we have been adding capacity. We will continue to do that to meet demand. There have been some ramp costs in our Optical Communications business. As we are able to make more and sell more, that improves our margins. You saw that nicely here in the third quarter. I think there's definitely some room above where we are to continue to grow from there.

**Question:** In a similar vein, the Hemlock ramp here, I'm just particularly interested in how we should think about margins for this business as well. Obviously, they're running a bit below last year's level as you kind of get through the early stages of the ramp. Any way we should be thinking about the timing of margins here, tracking back to those levels and then potentially surpassing it, especially when we're considering the impact of tax credits and some of the other subsidies.

**Ed Schlesinger:** Our goal here is to build a $2.5 billion business. You can sort of take our current run rate and get to, you know, how much incremental sales we'll add from there. We expect that business to be at or above the Corning operating margin level. You can, you know, think of it as being a very nice margin business when we're fully up and running. I think you'll see sort of incremental improvements as we add capacity and as we sell more. I don't know that I would particularly call out timing in any given quarter, but we should just continue to improve kind of quarter over quarter as we go.

**Wendell Weeks:** Let us get through this quarter in this crucial startup time with wafers and maybe a little bit into Q1. Then we ought to be able to provide a little more help to you on how the factory is coming up and how we think of it for the coming year. Right now, we're making that jump between making thousands of wafers a day to trying to make a million a day. That tends to focus our mind on the near term.

### Question 5: George Notter (Wolfe Research) - Supply Constraints

**Question:** I wanted to kind of talk a bit or ask a bit about the Optical Communications business in terms of just supply constraints. You know, talking with some folks around the industry, it sounds like you guys are no longer selling glass on an OEM basis to others. I assume it's because you've got more demand in your own internal glass needs than maybe you previously expected. Is that actually the case? Can you talk about what you're doing to expand capacity? I saw the expansion news in the Hickory facility this past week. I'm just wondering where lead times are and what the capacity expansions look like.

**Wendell Weeks:** I won't comment on our specific dialogues with our customers and what form they take our product on at this stage. I would say, George, that you are correct in that the demand for our products relative to our supply puts us in a situation where we are quite tight. We have pre-existing sort of ramps that we have been doing. Now, as we look to the accelerating demand from our customers, we're in dialogues with them about how to best set our manufacturing platform profile to serve them better for the future. How do we handle, sort of, the risk of that? How do we make sure that we de-risk any investments that we make through commitments and/or funding from our customer set? That's where we are right now, George. More to come as those things start to come together.

**Question:** Any comments on lead times?

**Wendell Weeks:** Gosh, you know, it really depends on the SKUs. There's no question, though, that everybody wants more from us faster, right? In that way, we are seeking to improve our lead times, because things are pretty tight. That being said, we've been able to meet, you know, really unplanned for growth from our customers in terms of demand. We've brought a number of new customers who have come on board for us because of the power of our innovations.

### Question 6: Wamsi Mohan (Bank of America) - Enterprise Sequential Growth

**Question:** Maybe to start in enterprise, if we look at the pace of quarter-on-quarter changes in revenues, it's a little bit below the same timeframe last year. That happened in Q2 and in Q3. I'm wondering if we can just kind of dissect what the reason behind that might be, given that the opportunity that you've highlighted here and the investments that you're pointing to across multiple hyperscalers and data centers is just seeming to be very strong.

**Wendell Weeks:** As we take a look at the year-over-year sequential quarter growth last year versus this year and why isn't the dollar sort of the same? Is that a demand question or is it a supply question? If that's where you're going, yeah, it's how much incremental supply was available one quarter to the next is the primary driver of that. We had a hunk more incremental supply in a particular SKU that enabled that jump last year and this year. In that way, I guess it's all timing is a way to think about it. It's not a demand piece. It's purely relative delta in supply between the years.

**Question:** Does that mean that you are undershipping demand fairly significantly now in Q3? Does that lead to a catch-up in Q4?

**Wendell Weeks:** Right now, if I could put more on my loading dock, our customers would take more. That is just true, right? We expect that situation to continue for the foreseeable future. It is coming to a supply piece for us. What particular products undo a bottleneck at what particular time is driving more of what we put in a guide for our total revenue as a company than it is can we sell more?

**Question:** Obviously very exciting news around Apple's investment in Harrodsburg. Now that we're talking about Apple on the call, can you help us think through if the economics in Specialty Materials change meaningfully for Corning, either on pricing or margins of these cover glass products, given the co-investment that is happening here?

**Wendell Weeks:** The key thing that will drive our relative profitability in Mobile Consumer Electronics will be the adoption of innovations and the rate of adoption of innovations. For us, one of the most exciting things about the Apple announcement is the very long-term commitment and the co-innovation center that is going to be there. What you can look through to that is saying you can expect a lot of amazing new products to come out of that collaboration. Usually, the more amazing the products are that we make, the more return benefit accrues to our investors. We would expect that historical approach, which we call more Corning, to continue.

### Question 7: Mehdi Hosseini (Susquehanna Financial Group) - Longer-term Opportunity

**Question:** As we look into the longer-term opportunity, especially given the success of the Springboard plan, should we expect that by 2026, 2027, the incremental revenue opportunities would be in the high single billion on a quarterly or $30 billion plus on an annualized basis?

**Wendell Weeks:** We'll owe you guys an update on the Springboard plan given our strong performance. It seems like we upgrade our Springboard plans, and then within just a couple of quarters, we perform so well that we get asked to update our Springboard plan again. As we look to early, we're in the middle of that process that runs through the remainder of this year and into early next. We'll give you a good, solid update on what it is we see.

**Question:** This has to do with your strategy with solar and also the acquisition of a JH Solar module manufacturing capacity from the last quarter. Should we assume that you would be able to make the entire solar module, including poly and the module itself, in an affordable way so that everything's made in the U.S. and used by U.S. customers? I'm focusing more on affordability, especially given the fact that the subsidies are fast going away.

**Wendell Weeks:** In the value chain, our area of focus has been on ingots and wafers. Yes, we also wanted to have a go-to-market position in modules, primarily because we have some new innovations to bring to that that could increase the conversion efficiency and provide some of the best products or maybe the best product in the world for solar is our hope. The core of what we're doing, you've nailed it in one, which is we would like to see a U.S. supply chain that is able to make products that are competitive versus the landed basis of solar products made overseas by the time we are done with our efforts here. Our focus should be on those areas that we can be really strong. We would rather source, I would say, the sell portion from other U.S. makers through time. But one way or the other, we want to bring our innovation to bear so that the U.S. has domestically manufactured solar power because it's just going to be super important, especially we've been talking so much about AI. AI needs power, needs U.S. source power. This is yet another super economical way for us to provide power, especially at speed.
