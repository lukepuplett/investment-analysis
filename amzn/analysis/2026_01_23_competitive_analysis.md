## Executive Summary (BLUF)

**Amazon maintains formidable competitive moats in cloud infrastructure (AWS 31-33% market share, $200B+ backlog) and e-commerce (300M+ Prime members, 1M+ robots, 1,000+ cities same-day delivery) but faces intensifying competition from Azure (gaining enterprise share through Microsoft 365 integration), GCP (winning AI-native workloads), Walmart (closing retail delivery gap), and Google/Meta (dominating digital advertising). AWS competitive position remains strongest—customer workload lock-in, proprietary services breadth (200+), and custom silicon differentiation (Trainium 30-40% better price/performance)—but Azure share gains accelerating (210-300 bps annually). Retail moat is defensible but under pressure: Walmart same-day coverage (90% US) rivals Amazon speed, price competition intensifying (Shein/Temu ultra-low-cost alternative), and fulfillment cost structure challenged by wage inflation. Advertising competitive position strengthening (full-funnel advantage via Prime Video + retail data, Netflix/Roku/Spotify partnerships) but remains #3 behind Google/Meta duopoly. Overall competitive assessment: Strong moats in AWS and retail network, developing moats in AI and advertising, but no position is unassailable. Conviction: Moats durable 5-10 years, but competitive share pressure likely in retail and cloud.**
