## Executive Summary (BLUF)

**Amazon operates across three massive, secular-growth TAMs totaling $8T+: Cloud Infrastructure ($1.8T), E-commerce Retail ($5T+), and Digital Advertising ($1T+). AWS (31-33% market share) dominates cloud infrastructure with secular tailwinds from AI/ML workload adoption (still <30% migrated to cloud), while e-commerce penetration (15-20% globally, 45-50% in developed markets) provides long runway for growth. Advertising TAM is largest but most nascent in Amazon's context—retail media 80-85% in physical stores, digital shift creating $300B+ opportunity. Competitive intensity is rising across all segments: Azure/GCP gaining cloud share, Walmart/Target closing delivery gap in retail, Google/Meta maintaining duopoly in digital advertising. Near-term catalysts include AWS AI infrastructure demand (Trainium adoption, Bedrock scaling), perishable grocery expansion (2,300 cities by year-end 2025), and advertising partnerships (Netflix/Roku/Spotify). Market backdrop: Recession risk muting enterprise IT spending; e-commerce volume pressure from macro headwinds; advertising CPM pressure from supply abundance. Overall market assessment: Secular tailwinds remain intact, but near-term growth moderation risk from competitive saturation and macro weakness.**
