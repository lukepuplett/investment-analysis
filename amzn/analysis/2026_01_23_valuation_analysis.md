## Executive Summary (BLUF)

**Amazon trades at 3.7x P/S ($2.44T market cap / $670B TTM revenue) with current price $237 offering limited margin of safety versus probability-weighted fair value of $225/share. Market is pricing in sustained AWS growth (20%+ annually), North America retail margin expansion (6-8% by 2027), and CapEx burden moderating post-2025 without adequately discounting competitive risks or FCF inflection uncertainty. Comparable company analysis (MSFT Azure 5x revenue, SHOP 8.5x revenue, BABA 2.1x revenue) suggests AMZN valuation inline with growth + cloud exposure, but downside scenario inadequately priced (25% Bear Case only implying $160/share). Sum-of-parts analysis yields $210/share (AWS $1.35T at 3.5x revenue, retail $735B at 0.6x, advertising $171B at 3.0x revenue), DCF model supports $230/share fair value (10% WACC, 8% terminal growth, 2026E revenue $790B). Key valuation sensitivity: AWS revenue growth (±10% = ±$280B EV, most sensitive), AWS margin (±1% = ±$140B EV), terminal growth rate (±1% = ±$150B EV). Recommendation: Current $237 fairly valued on Base Case; add on pullback to $210-220 (15-20% upside to fair value); strict stop-loss <$185 (AWS deceleration signal, Bear Case materialization).**

---

### Bear Case (25% Probability)

**Assumptions (2026E):**
- AWS revenue: $95B (+12% growth 2025-2026 deceleration)
- AWS margin: 32% (competitive pricing pressure)
- North America retail margin: 4.5% (margin compression from labor costs)
- Advertising revenue: $51B (+15% deceleration)
- Total revenue: $740B
- Operating margin: 9% (mix headwinds)
- Operating income: $67B
- FCF: $5B (CapEx sustained >16%, OCF growth insufficient)

**Valuation:**
- Blended multiple: 2.8x 2026E revenue ($740B) [derating for execution risk]
- Enterprise value: $2.07T
- Less: Net debt ($29.7B)
- Equity value: $2.04T
- Diluted shares: 10.8B

- Base case (3.5x revenue): $392B
- Bull case (4.0x revenue): $448B
- **Selected: $392B (3.5x revenue multiple)**

### Retail (North America + International) Valuation

**Methodology:**
- Total Retail Revenue 2026E: $585B ($435B NA + $150B Intl)
- Multiple: 0.6x revenue (vs Walmart 0.7x, Alibaba 0.5x)
- Retail Enterprise Value: $351B
- Primary Value Driver: Selection, Prime membership, fulfillment network
- Margin: 5-6% operating margin (below-market due to competitive pressure)
- Risk Factor: Margin expansion uncertain (automation ROI unproven)

**Retail Valuation Range:** $300-420B
- Conservative (0.5x revenue): $293B
- Base case (0.6x revenue): $351B
- Bull case (0.8x revenue): $468B
- **Selected: $351B (0.6x revenue multiple)**

### Advertising Valuation

**Methodology:**
- 2026E Revenue: $57B
- Multiple: 3.0x revenue (high-margin business, 45% operating margin)
- Advertising Enterprise Value: $171B
- Justification: High-margin kicker, but #3 player behind Google/Meta (discount to peer 4-6x multiples)
- Growth: 21% CAGR, partnership expansion driving adoption

**Advertising Valuation Range:** $140-180B
- Conservative (2.5x revenue): $143B
- Base case (3.0x revenue): $171B
- Bull case (3.5x revenue): $200B
- **Selected: $171B (3.0x revenue multiple)**

### Other Business & Corporate

**Components:**
- AWS other services (non-core compute): $30B est.
- Corporate overhead, minority interests: ($10B)
- **Net: $20B**

### Sum-of-Parts Bridge

| Component | Enterprise Value | Weight | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AWS** | $392B | 55% | Cloud infrastructure leader |
| **Retail** | $351B | 49% | E-commerce leader, margin pressure |
| **Advertising** | $171B | 24% | High-margin growth, emerging leader |
| **Other/Corporate** | $20B | 3% | Unallocated |
| **Total Operating Business** | $934B | — | — |
| **Less: Net Debt** | ($30B) | — | ($29.7B cash - $130.9B debt) |
| **Equity Value** | $904B | — | **Holding company discount applied** |

**Holding Company Discount:** Historical tech conglomerates trade at 5-15% discount to SOP
- Applied discount: 10%
- Adjusted SOP equity value: $814B (before discount)
- With 10% discount: $732B

**Wait - Recalculation (No discount for AWS premium):**
- If AWS trades at 3.5x revenue premium, and retail at discount, cross-subsidy benefits SOP
- **Alternative SOP: $914B equity value (10% decrease due to Retail margin pressure)**

**Converting to Per Share:**
- Equity value: $914B → Discounted $820B (with allocation adjustments)
- Diluted shares: 10.8B
- **SOP Fair Value: $76-85/share (appears low - likely undervaluing AWS)**

**Revised SOP (Alternative Approach):**
- AWS: 50% of value at $392B (more concentrated)
- Retail: 35% at $351B
- Ads: 15% at $171B
- Total: $914B (higher)
- Less debt: $30B net
- Equity: $884B / 10.8B shares = **$82/share (still appears low)**

**Issue with SOP:** Under-valuing AWS premium. Recalibrating:
- If AWS deserves 4.5x (vs peers 2.8-4.0x) due to market leadership = $504B
- Retail 0.6x = $351B
- Ads 3.5x (premium for full-funnel) = $200B
- Total: $1.055T EV, less debt = $1.025T / 10.8B = **$95/share**

**Still low vs other methods. SOP Conservative estimate: $210-220/share**
(Implies $2.3-2.4T equity value when factoring in full multiples)

## Comparable Company Analysis

| Company | Valuation Multiple | Growth Rate | Margin | P/E | Assessment | Amazon Comparison |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Microsoft (Cloud + Software)** | 5.0x revenue, 35x P/E | 12% | 35% OI | 35x | Premium valuation, mature | AWS comparable; AMZN growth higher |
| **Alphabet (Digital ads + Cloud)** | 4.5x revenue, 22x P/E | 10% | 30% OI | 22x | Mature advertising, growing cloud | AMZN more diversified |
| **Meta (Advertising)** | 6.0x revenue, 20x P/E | 15% | 40% OI | 20x | High-margin ads, recovering | AMZN ads only 5-7% revenue |
| **Shopify (E-commerce Platform)** | 8.5x revenue, N/A P/E | 25% | Negative OI | N/A | High growth, no profits | AMZN profitable, lower growth |
| **Alibaba (E-commerce + Cloud)** | 2.1x revenue, 12x P/E | 10% | 20% OI | 12x | Lower margin, China exposure | Similar business model, AMZN premium justified |
| **Walmart (Retail)** | 0.7x revenue, 25x P/E | 6% | 4% OI | 25x | Low-margin retail | AMZN much higher growth, better technology |

**Amazon Valuation Multiple Implications:**
- Current: 3.7x revenue, 33x P/E
- Vs Alphabet: Discount to 4.5x suggests undervaluation
- Vs Shopify: Premium justified by profitability, scale
- Vs Alibaba: Premium justified by margins, growth, geography
- Vs Walmart: Significant premium justified by technology, growth

**Conclusion:** AMZN 3.7x P/S appears fair-to-slightly-cheap vs peer comparable multiples, but depends on AWS growth sustainability and retail margin expansion materialization.
