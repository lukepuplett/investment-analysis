## Executive Summary (BLUF)

**Amazon delivered record TTM revenue of $691.3B (+11.0% YoY from 2024) with expanding profitability (gross margin 50.06%, operating margin 11.02%, net margin 11.06%) and exceptional earnings growth (diluted EPS $7.08, +28% YoY). However, the company is in a capital-intensive investment cycle with $125B+ full-year CapEx in 2025 (17.4% of revenue, up from 13% historically) compressing FCF from $32.9B (2024) to $10.6B (TTM), despite strong operating cash flow ($130.7B TTM, +21% YoY). AWS ($132B annualized run rate, 20.2% YoY growth) generates 60%+ of operating income at 34.6% margins while North America retail operates at only 4.5% margins (6.9% ex-FTC settlement). Advertising ($17.6B Q3, +22% YoY) provides high-margin growth kicker. Key financial dynamic: AWS profit engine subsidizing retail infrastructure investment and AI capacity buildout. Path to normalized FCF ($50-60B by 2027E) depends critically on CapEx moderation and AWS margin sustainability. Near-term valuation compression risk exists if AWS growth decelerates or ROIC on infrastructure investments disappoints.**

## Cash Flow Analysis

### Operating Cash Flow (Strong & Growing)

| Metric | TTM | 12/31/2024 | 12/31/2023 | 9M 2025 | 9M 2024 | YoY 9M |
|--------|-----|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Operating Cash Flow** | $130.7B | $112.3B | $93.6B | $85.1B | $70.3B | **+21%** |
| **OCF Margin** | 18.9% | 17.6% | 16.3% | 15.6% | 14.4% | +120 bps |
| **Working Capital (9M)** | ($22.1B) | — | — | ($22.1B) | ($14.4B) | —  |

**OCF Quality:**
- Strong and accelerating growth: +21% YoY on 9M basis
- High-quality earnings: 8 of every $10 operating income converts to cash
- Working capital drag: $22B tied up in growth (inventory buildup, payables timing)
- Sustainability: AWS and advertising provide recurring, high-margin OCF

### Capital Expenditure (Elevated & Increasing)

| Metric | TTM | 12/31/2024 | 12/31/2023 | 9M 2025 | 9M 2024 | YoY 9M |
|--------|-----|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|--------|
| **CapEx** | $120.1B | $82.9B | $66.8B | $89.9B | $51.7B | **+74%** |
| **CapEx as % Revenue** | 17.4% | 13.0% | 11.6% | 16.5% | 10.6% | +590 bps |
| **Implied 2025 Full-Year CapEx** | ~$125B | — | — | — | — | **+51% vs 2024** |
| **2026 Management Expectation** | Further increases | — | — | — | — | **TBD (likely $140B+)** |

**CapEx Composition & Rationale:**
- Primary driver: AWS infrastructure for AI/ML workloads (80%+)
  - Power capacity: 3.8GW added (12M), 1GW+ Q4 2025, doubling through 2027
  - Custom silicon: Project Rainier (1M Trainium 2 chips by year-end), Trainium 3 Q1 2026
  - Data center build-out: Supporting Bedrock, SageMaker, customer workloads
- Secondary driver: Fulfillment network & automation (20%)
  - 1M+ robots deployed, continuing expansion
  - Perishable grocery infrastructure: 2,300 cities by year-end 2025
  - Rural expansion: $4B+ investment for same-day/next-day delivery

**Management Guidance (Q3 2025 Earnings Call):**
- CapEx expected to reach ~$125B for full-year 2025
- Further increases expected in 2026 (peak CapEx cycle)
- Rationale: "Strong returns on invested capital expected"; "massive opportunity in AI"
- Capacity monetization: "As fast as we're adding capacity, we are monetizing it"

### Free Cash Flow (Compressed but Intentional)

| Metric | TTM | 12/31/2024 | 12/31/2023 | 9M 2025 | 9M 2024 |
|--------|-----|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Free Cash Flow** | $10.6B | $32.9B | $26.8B | ($4.8B) | $18.6B |
| **FCF Margin** | 1.5% | 5.2% | 4.7% | -0.9% | 3.8% |
| **FCF Decline** | -68% YoY | — | — | — | — |

**FCF Compression Analysis:**
- TTM FCF $10.6B (down 68% from 2024: $32.9B) despite 21% OCF growth
- 9M 2025 FCF negative ($4.8B) due to lumpy CapEx timing
- Root cause: CapEx escalation ($120B TTM, +51% vs 2024) outpacing OCF growth
- Management assessment: Intentional strategic choice to maximize capacity monetization

**Path to FCF Normalization (Model):**
- 2025E FCF: ~$10B (normalized, Q4 CapEx timing)
- 2026E FCF: ~$25-30B (CapEx moderating to 15-16% revenue, OCF $110B+)
- 2027E FCF: ~$50-60B (CapEx declining to 12-13% revenue, OCF $120B+)
- Critical assumptions: AWS growth sustained >18%, margin compression limited

- Manageable debt maturity profile
- Interest expense minimal ($2.2B TTM) vs operating income ($76B)
- CapEx funding: Self-funded through OCF + incremental debt

### Working Capital Management

| Metric | 12/31/2024 | 12/31/2023 | Commentary |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Accounts Receivable** | ~$36B | ~$32B | AWS + advertising receivables growing |
| **Inventory** | ~$18B | ~$17B | Just-in-time, lean management |
| **Accounts Payable** | ~$88B | ~$79B | Strong supplier relationships, extended terms |
| **Days Sales Outstanding** | ~20-25 days | — | Healthy collections (AWS majority) |
| **Inventory Turnover** | —  | — | Higher turns than retail peers (1P + 3P mix) |

**Working Capital Observations:**
- Favorable working capital structure: High AP, low inventory
- 3P seller model (62% mix) creates cash timing benefit
- Growth-driven WC investment: $22B tie-up in 9M 2025
- Opportunity: Continued supplier term optimization

## Return Metrics

### Return on Equity & Assets (TTM)

| Metric | TTM | 12/31/2024 | 12/31/2023 | 5-Year Average |
|--------|-----|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **ROE (Net Income / Equity)** | 26.7% | 20.7% | 10.6% | ~15% |
| **ROA (Net Income / Assets)** | 12.2% | 10.3% | 5.3% | ~8% |
| **Operating Return** | 12.2% | 9.5% | 6.4% | ~8% |

**Return Analysis:**
- ROE exceptional: 26.7% (top quartile for large-cap tech)
- ROA strong: 12.2% (reflecting efficient asset utilization)
- Return improvement: YoY improvement in both metrics
- Capital efficiency: AWS generates 35%+ operating returns; retail 2-3%

### AWS Return on Invested Capital (Implied)

| Metric | AWS Est. | Commentary |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Invested Capital** | ~$150-180B | Data centers, infrastructure, R&D |
| **Operating Income (Annualized)** | $46.8B | 35.5% operating margin on $132B revenue |
| **ROIC (Implied)** | ~25-30% | Exceptional (well above corporate WACC) |
| **Competitive Advantage** | High | Justifies continued investment |

## Dividend & Share Repurchase Policy

| Metric | Current | TTM | Commentary |
|--------|---------|-----|-----------|
| **Dividend per Share** | $0.00 | $0.00 | No dividend (reinvesting in growth) |
| **Share Buybacks** | Limited | $6.1B | Authorization but limited execution |
| **Share Count (Diluted)** | 10.8B | ~10.8B | Essentially flat (minimal dilution) |
| **EPS Growth Driver** | Earnings | +28% | Earnings growth, not buybacks |

**Capital Allocation Strategy:**
- Primary: CapEx investment ($125B+) in AWS infrastructure
- Secondary: M&A (strategic acquisitions like Anthropic $9.5B gain in Q3)
- Tertiary: Minimal shareholder distributions
- Rationale: High-return investment opportunities (AWS, AI) exceed shareholder return alternatives

## Key Segment Margin Analysis

### Segment Operating Margins (TTM/LTM)

| Segment | Operating Margin | Margin Trend | Key Drivers |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|
| **AWS** | 34.6% (Q3) | Expanding (36%+ implied TTM) | Scale, mix shift to higher-margin services |
| **North America** | 4.5% (Q3, 6.9% ex-FTC) | Flat-to-improving | Automation, fulfillment optimization |

## Critical Metrics to Monitor

### Quarterly Monitoring (Most Important)
1. **AWS Revenue Growth Rate** - Must sustain >18% quarterly (Bull thesis requires >20%)
2. **AWS Operating Margin** - Monitor for compression (must sustain 34%+)
3. **North America Operating Margin** - Track automation ROI (target 6%+)
4. **Operating Cash Flow** - Must sustain $30B+ quarterly run-rate
5. **CapEx as % Revenue** - Watch for moderation signal (should peak 2025, decline 2026)
6. **Advertising Revenue Growth** - Monitor for deceleration (target >20% sustained)

### Annual Monitoring
1. **Free Cash Flow Path** - Must show inflection to $30B+ by 2026E
2. **Gross Margin** - Monitor for stabilization (support from mix shift)
3. **Return on Invested Capital** - AWS ROIC must remain >20-25%
4. **Customer Concentration** - AWS backlog and diversification
