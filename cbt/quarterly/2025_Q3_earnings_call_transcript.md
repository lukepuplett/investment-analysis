## Q&A Session

### Question 1: Saurabh Dhir (Mizuho) - Tariff Rates and Demand

**Q:** Relationship between tariffs and demand in North America? At what tariff rates would domestic production become competitive?

**A (Sean Keohane):**
- **Passenger Car Tires:**
  - Southeast Asia: 19%-29% tariffs (Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia)
  - Additional anti-dumping and countervailing duties may apply
  - China: ~70% tariffs (main reason imports come from SE Asia, not China)
  - Mexico/Canada: Zero tariffs (USMCA compliant)
- **Directional Impact:** Tariffs and anti-dumping duties will likely have positive effect on market, enhancing competitiveness of local production
- **Magnitude/Timing:** Hard to predict
- **Tire Major Actions:**
  - Bridgestone: Revitalizing Firestone brand (tier two)
  - Michelin: Expect tier three tire imports to reduce in 2025
- **Overall:** Directionally positive for local production

### Question 2: Jeff Zekauskas (JPMorgan) - Americas Volume Differences

**Q:** Difference in volumes between North America and South America?

**A (Sean Keohane):**
- Americas volumes down 9% YoY (Reinforcement Materials)
- Driven by tariff uncertainty and weaker macro
- Tire imports leveled off in North America May YTD
- Tire imports declined in South America May YTD
- South America volumes weaker: weak market + volume losses from contract season last year

**Q:** How is business at Altamira different now? Tariff regime impact?

**A (Sean Keohane):**
- No tariff changes for tires or carbon black (USMCA compliant)
- Sole manufacturer in Mexico
- Customers are Mexican-located tire plants
- Not moving carbon black into US (local production)
- Bridgestone acquisition:
  - Expected annual EBIT: ~$10M (year 1), ~$15M (year 2)
  - Expected EBITDA: ~$20M (year 2)
  - Financially attractive

**Q:** Carbon black price negotiations in North America?

**A (Sean Keohane):**
- Early stages of contract negotiations
- Typical timing: Starts in summer, progresses through fall

### Question 3: Chris Perrella (UBS, for Josh Spector) - Inventory Overhang

**Q:** How large is inventory overhang from tire imports ahead of tariffs? Could tariffs impact demand in last two months of fiscal year?

**A (Sean Keohane):**
- Tire inventories largely in balance per tire maker commentary
- Exception: Some budget brands may have elevated levels
- Expected to normalize this quarter
- Tariff impact timing: Later this year and into 2026 as market processes and customers adjust supply chains
- Global majors investing to revitalize tier two brands

**Q:** Brazil countervailing duties - how much customer production ships from US to Brazil?

**A (Sean Keohane):**
- Tire makers produce in Brazil and ship to North America
- If tariff regime makes Brazil less competitive, customers rebalance production
- Many customers have production assets in Mexico and other countries
- Expected rebalancing across global plant network

### Question 4: Laurence Alexander (Jefferies) - Network Optimization & Operating Leverage

**Q:** What does network optimization mean for operating leverage when demand accelerates? Higher incremental margins?

**A (Sean Keohane):**
- Network optimization is broad:
  - More advantageous product mix
  - Matching demand to most competitive assets with best delivered cost economics
- Also working on cost and procurement savings
- Strong results given weak demand environment

**A (Erica McLaughlin):**
- Fixed cost and procurement initiatives: Targeting ~$30M for year
- Trending ahead of target
- Mix of structural (restructuring actions) and timing (travel, third party expenses)
- Would be favorable to operating leverage, not negative

### Question 5: Jeff Zekauskas (JPMorgan) - Corporate Costs & Americas Volume Trends

**Q:** Unallocated corporate costs $39M vs $51M (YTD), $12M better. How achieved?

**A (Erica McLaughlin):**
- Part of cost reduction initiatives
- Mix of headcount actions, timing/lower third party spend
- Trending ~$13M per quarter this year
- Expected September: $16M-$17M (more similar to last year)
- Mix of structural (continue) and timing (could come back if environment improves)

**Q:** Carbon black volumes in Americas: Negative 6% in 2023, 2024, and likely 2025. Why weaker than EMEA/Asia?

**A (Sean Keohane):**
- Primary driver: Elevated tire imports over last couple years
- Depressed local production levels
- Forward outlook depends on:
  1. Where tariff and anti-dumping duty levels end up (directionally supportive)
  2. Global majors revitalizing tier two brands
- Timing and magnitude hard to predict

**Q:** Should we infer utilization rates in Americas have moved lower?

**A (Sean Keohane):**
- Utilization is function of supply and demand
- Supply side: No material adds in Western mature markets
- Demand side: Volume impact from tire imports
- Starting to see settle out
- Tire majors expect import levels to begin turning
- Depends on how trade situation plays out
