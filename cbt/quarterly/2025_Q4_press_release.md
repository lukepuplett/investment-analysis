## Management Commentary

### Sean Keohane, Cabot President and Chief Executive Officer

**On Fiscal Year Performance:**
"I am very pleased with another strong year of Adjusted EPS growth where we achieved $7.25, up 3% year over year, in a year with a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. This performance was driven by higher EBIT in our Performance Chemicals segment which increased 18% year over year, partially offset by EBIT in our Reinforcement Materials segment which declined 5%. We delivered a solid fourth quarter with Adjusted EPS of $1.70, consistent with our expectations and which represents a decrease of 6% over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Our continued operational and commercial discipline along with strong execution allowed us to drive countermeasures to deliver earnings growth in a volatile economic environment."

**On Capital Allocation:**
"Strong operating performance in the year resulted in the company generating $665 million in operating cash flow, which enabled us to continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities. In addition, we paid $96 million in dividends, including a 5% increase announced in May, and we repurchased $168 million of shares of our common stock. Our balance sheet remains strong despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop, with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.2 times, which allows us to invest to grow the company while returning capital to shareholders."

**On Outlook:**
"Looking ahead to fiscal 2026, we do not yet see signs of improvement in the external environment, particularly as it relates to regional demand trends in Reinforcement Materials due to the impact of elevated Asian tire imports into western regions. As a result, we expect Adjusted EPS to be in the range of $6.00 to $7.00 for the year. Our fiscal 2026 outlook reflects the uncertain macroeconomic and trade environment and competitive headwinds in Reinforcement Materials. In Performance Chemicals, we expect to see profit improvement overall, driven by attractive areas such as Battery Materials and targeted infrastructure, alternative energy, and consumer applications. We anticipate strong operating cash flow and discretionary free cash flow to support growth investments."

"While market conditions remain challenging, we continue to execute on our foundation of commercial and operational excellence and we remain focused on managing costs, strengthening operations, and positioning the company for long-term growth. Backed by a strong balance sheet and our demonstrated ability to generate solid cash flow, we remain well positioned to continue to return capital to shareholders and fund strategic growth projects that we expect to deliver value to shareholders."
