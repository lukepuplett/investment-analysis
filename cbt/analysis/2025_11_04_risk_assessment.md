# Cabot Corporation (CBT) – Risk Assessment

**Date:** November 4, 2025  
**Analysis Period:** Q4 FY2025 (Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2025)

---

## Executive Summary

**BLUF: Cabot faces moderate to elevated risks from cyclical market headwinds (Asian tire imports, weak auto production), competitive intensity, and macro uncertainty, but mitigates these through strong balance sheet ($1.5B liquidity, 1.2x net debt/EBITDA), operational excellence, and strategic positioning in high-growth markets. Key risks include volume declines in Reinforcement Materials, trade policy uncertainty, and technology disruption, while financial risks are low given strong cash generation and conservative leverage. Overall risk profile is moderate with manageable risks offset by strong financial position and operational capabilities. MODERATE RISK - Strong risk mitigation offsets cyclical and competitive challenges.**
