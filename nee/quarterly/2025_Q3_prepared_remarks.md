#### Florida Power & Light (FPL) Overview

**Performance Excellence:**
- **Reliability**: FPL customers experience top decile reliability that's nearly 60% better than the national average
- **Customer Bills**: Typical FPL residential bills are 20% lower than they were 20 years ago when adjusted for inflation
- **Efficiency**: FPL's non-fuel O&M costs are 70% lower than the national average and over 50% lower than second best in the industry
- **Power Generation**: Approximately 90% of FPL's power generation comes from the nation's largest gas-fired fleet and four nuclear units

**Strategic Approach:**
- **Base Load Power**: Robust gas and nuclear fleet provides flexibility to meet customers' needs with the lowest cost forms of energy right now – solar and storage
- **Daytime Peak Focus**: Don't necessarily need "nighttime" electrons. Need more low-cost electrons to meet daytime peak
- **Perfect Complement**: Solar and storage are the perfect complement and choice for FPL's system and customers today
- **Future Preparation**: FPL is preparing for the future, which will require even more baseload gas generation and perhaps further down the road, nuclear generation

**Growth Investment:**
- **State Growth**: Florida is one of the nation's fastest-growing states and the world's 16th largest economy
- **Capital Investment**: FPL plans to invest approximately $40 billion over the next 4 years in new "all of the above" energy infrastructure
  - 5.3 gigawatts in solar
  - 3.4 gigawatts in battery storage
  - Gas peaker plant (pending regulatory approvals)
- **Multi-Decade Approach**: Continuing successful, multi-decade approach of adding low-cost generation to meet Florida's growing need for power, while increasing reliability and keeping customer bills low

**Rate Proposal:**
- **Initiation**: February 28th initiation of FPL's 2025 base rate proceeding for new rates, effective in January 2026
- **Settlement**: Proposed settlement agreement reached in August with most intervenors, reflecting broad set of constituents across customer base
- **Key Terms**:
  - Four-year proposed agreement
  - Allowed midpoint regulatory return on equity: 10.95% (range: 9.95% to 11.95%)
  - No change to FPL's equity ratio: 59.6%
  - Rate stabilization mechanism similar to what was filed in February
  - Two new large load tariffs designed to ensure large load customers pay for incremental generation needed to serve them
- **Customer Impact**: If approved, typical residential customer bills would increase only about 2% annually between 2025 and 2029
- **Bill Position**: Bills would remain well below the current national average
- **Economic Certainty**: Provides customers with economic certainty from a four-year rate agreement
