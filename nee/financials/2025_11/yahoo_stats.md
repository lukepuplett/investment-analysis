## Analysis
NextEra Energy trades at premium valuation multiples (P/E: 27.24, P/S: 6.22, EV/EBITDA: 17.74) reflecting its position as a leading renewable energy developer and regulated utility operator. The company demonstrates exceptional profitability with operating margins of 30.77% and profit margins of 24.73%, driven by both its regulated FPL operations and its competitive renewable energy business.

**Strengths:**
- Exceptional profitability metrics (30.77% operating margin, 24.73% profit margin)
- Strong earnings growth (31.60% YoY quarterly earnings growth)
- Stable dividend yield (2.77% forward yield) with 70.30% payout ratio
- High institutional ownership (82.73%) indicating professional investor confidence

**Concerns:**
- Premium valuation multiples across all metrics
- Weak current ratio (0.55) indicating limited short-term liquidity
- High leverage (144.16% debt/equity ratio)
- Negative levered free cash flow (-$13.65B TTM) due to heavy capital investments
- Underperforming market (3.50% vs 18.29% S&P 500)

The negative free cash flow reflects NextEra's aggressive capital investment program in renewable energy infrastructure, which is expected to drive future growth. The high leverage is typical for utility companies and is supported by stable, regulated cash flows from FPL.
