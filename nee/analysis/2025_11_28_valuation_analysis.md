|------|--------------|--------|--------------|-----|-------------------|
| 2024 | $3.43        | --     | $11.97B      | -$13.65B | $2.21 |
| 2025E | $3.58       | 4.4%   | $12.50B      | -$12.00B | $2.27 |
| 2026E | $3.82       | 6.7%   | $13.20B      | -$10.50B | $2.50 |
| 2027E | $4.09       | 7.1%   | $14.00B      | -$9.00B | $2.75 |
| 2028E | $4.35       | 6.4%   | $14.80B      | -$8.00B | $3.00 |
| 2029E | $4.62       | 6.2%   | $15.65B      | -$7.00B | $3.25 |

#### DCF Assumptions
- **Terminal Growth Rate**: 3.0% (long-term GDP growth, utility-like)
- **Discount Rate**: 7.5% (WACC for utility with growth)
- **Terminal FCF Multiple**: 15x (mature utility)
- **Terminal Operating Margin**: 30% (maintains premium margins)

#### DCF Valuation
| Component | Value | Calculation |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Present Value of FCF (2025-2029)** | -$38.5B | Discounted cash flows (negative due to investment) |
| **Terminal Value** | $220.0B | $14.67B terminal FCF × 15x / (1.075)^5 |
| **Present Value of Terminal Value** | $153.2B | Terminal value discounted |
| **Enterprise Value** | $114.7B | Sum of components |
| **Net Debt** | $80.9B | Debt - cash |
| **Equity Value** | $193.8B | Enterprise value - net debt |
| **Shares Outstanding** | 2.08B | Current shares |
| **DCF Value Per Share** | **$93.17** | Equity value / shares |

**Note**: DCF shows negative near-term FCF due to aggressive capital investment, but strong terminal value drives valuation.

### 2. Earnings-Based Valuation

#### P/E Multiple Approach
| Scenario | 2025E EPS | P/E Multiple | Rationale | Value Per Share |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Conservative** | $3.58 | 22x | Utility average + growth premium | $78.76 |
| **Base Case** | $3.58 | 25x | Current multiple, justified by quality | $89.50 |
| **Optimistic** | $3.58 | 28x | Premium for exceptional quality | $100.24 |

**Base Case Valuation**: $89.50 per share (9.4% upside)

#### Growth-Adjusted P/E (PEG Ratio)
- **Current PEG**: 2.78 (5-year expected)
- **Target PEG**: 2.5x (reasonable for quality growth)
- **Growth Rate**: 6-8% annual
- **Implied P/E**: 2.5 × 7% = 17.5x to 2.5 × 8% = 20x
- **Valuation Range**: $3.58 × 17.5x = $62.65 to $3.58 × 20x = $71.60

**Analysis**: PEG suggests current valuation may be rich, but quality justifies premium.

### 3. Sum-of-the-Parts Valuation

#### Business Segment Valuation
| Segment | 2025E Earnings | Multiple | Rationale | Value |
|---------|----------------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **FPL (Regulated Utility)** | $2.14B | 18x | Utility multiple | $38.5B |
| **Energy Resources** | $1.50B | 30x | Growth multiple | $45.0B |

| **Total Earnings** | **$3.58B** | **23.0x** | **Weighted average** | **$82.5B** |

**Per Share Value**: $82.5B / 2.08B shares = **$39.66 per share** (earnings-based)

**Adjusted for Growth**:
- FPL: $38.5B × 1.10 (growth premium) = $42.4B
- Energy Resources: $45.0B × 1.15 (growth premium) = $51.8B
- **Total Equity Value**: $94.2B
- **Per Share Value**: **$45.29 per share**

**Note**: Sum-of-the-parts using earnings multiples suggests lower valuation, but market values growth premium.
