## Themes for November 2025 Analysis Documents
- **Business Model**: Diversifying customer mix and expanding beyond core AI labs; leveraging self-build and M&A to extend platform differentiation.
- **Financial Health**: Balancing high-growth revenue with heavy capex and leverage; gross cash build supports expansion but interest burden notable.
- **Growth Catalysts**: Contracted backlog, NVIDIA collaboration, global buildout, CoreWeave Ventures.
- **Risks**: Supply chain execution, capex intensity, leverage (381% debt/equity), contract dependency on mega customers despite diversification progress.
- **Valuation Context**: Compression in multiples (EV/Revenue down from 33.3x to 18.4x since June) suggesting market digesting scale-up vs. execution risk.
