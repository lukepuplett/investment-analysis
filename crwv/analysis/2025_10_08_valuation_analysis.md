3. **Capital Intensity**: High CapEx requirements
4. **Competitive Pressure**: Major tech companies entering market
5. **Execution Risk**: Complex infrastructure deployment

### Recommendation
**BUY with CAUTION** - CoreWeave presents compelling upside potential with asset value significantly exceeding market cap ($117-122B assets vs $68B market cap). While weak cash flow coverage creates risk, the strong asset backing (8x coverage) and exceptional growth trajectory (206% YoY) justify a BUY position.

**Investment Thesis:**
- **Asset Value Play**: 73-79% upside from current market cap based on asset value
- **Growth Potential**: 46-193% upside in base to bull cases
- **Downside Protection**: Strong asset backing limits downside risk

2. **Profitability Improvement**: Path to positive operating margins
3. **Execution**: Successful infrastructure deployment and Core Scientific integration
4. **Competition**: Response to major tech company entries

**Position Sizing**: 2-3% of portfolio (high risk, high reward)
**Time Horizon**: 2-3 years minimum

**Key Insight**: The $9B Core Scientific acquisition provides strong asset backing (8x coverage) and reduces lease dependency, improving the debt profile despite high debt/equity ratios.

The stock offers significant upside potential with strong asset backing, but requires careful monitoring of cash flow improvement and execution.
