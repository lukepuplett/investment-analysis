## Income Statement Trends
- Revenue accelerated to $1.365B with broad-based AI infrastructure demand; backlog supports multi-quarter visibility.
- Operating income declined to $51.9M as technology and infrastructure expense ballooned to $747.5M, reflecting rapid capacity build-out.
- Net loss narrowed YoY (from -$359.8M) despite a tripling of interest expense to $310.6M, aided by a $126.7M tax benefit.

## Margin Analysis
| Metric | Value | Period |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Gross Margin (implied) | 73% | Q3 2025 |
| Operating Margin | 4% | Q3 2025 |
| Net Margin | -8% | Q3 2025 |
| Adjusted Operating Margin | 16% | Q3 2025 |
| Adjusted EBITDA Margin | 61% | Q3 2025 |

- Gross margin resilience highlights CoreWeave’s pricing power despite higher depreciation and lease costs.
- GAAP operating margin compression stems from scaling technology and infrastructure opex (+162% YoY) and elevated G&A to support global operations.
- Adjusted margin profile remains robust (61% adj. EBITDA) but shows slight YoY dilution versus 65% prior-year, signalling reinvestment intensity.

## Cash Flow and Capex
| Metric | Value | Period |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Net Cash from Operations | $1,689.1M | Q3 2025 |
| Operating Cash Flow (TTM) | $637.9M | TTM |
| Purchase of PPE | -$3,278.8M | Q3 2025 |
| Capex (9M) | -$6,249.2M | YTD Q3 2025 |
| Net Cash from Financing | $2,586.0M | Q3 2025 |

- Working capital release (deferred revenue +$659.3M, payables +$622.4M) drove quarterly operating cash inflow above EBITDA.
- Capex remains outsized at $3.3B for the quarter; management signaled 2026 capex will exceed 2025 levels (>2x), implying continued free-cash-flow deficits absent new financing.
- Financing inflows reflect $4.02B of new debt issuance (9% unsecured notes, DDTL facilities) offset by $1.40B repayments; equity dilution minimal this quarter.

## Balance Sheet and Liquidity
| Metric | Value | Period |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Cash & Cash Equivalents | $1,894.4M | 9/30/2025 |
| Restricted Cash (current) | $596.8M | 9/30/2025 |
| Total Debt | $14,034.9M | 9/30/2025 |
| Debt/Equity | 381.14% | MRQ |
| Current Ratio | 0.52 | MRQ |
| Shareholders’ Equity | $3,878.0M | 9/30/2025 |

- Cash plus restricted cash sits at $2.49B, bolstered by recent debt raises; liquidity covers near-term build commitments but remains reliant on continued capital market access.
- Balance sheet flipped to positive equity ($3.88B) after eliminating the Series C preferred put right, improving optics for counterparties.
- High leverage (381% debt/equity) and low current ratio (0.52) underscore the need for disciplined capex sequencing and potential structured financing (OEM financing, customer prepayments).

## Guidance and Forward View
- Backlog of $55.6B provides revenue visibility, but Q4 revenue may be gated by third-party data center shell delays; management expects customers to accept delivery shifts without economic loss.
- 2026 capex expected to more than double 2025 spend, implying sustained financing needs and potential margin volatility as assets are stood up ahead of revenue recognition.
- Management focus on self-build projects should reduce dependency on delayed partners and improve long-term cost structure once volume ramps.
- Customer concentration improved dramatically (largest customer <35%, 60% investment-grade), supporting backlog credit quality and reducing single-customer risk highlighted during the earnings Q&A.
- 2025 capex guidance was reduced to $12–14B (roughly 40% below prior expectations) as projects shift into early 2026; while framed as timing, the market reaction underscores sensitivity to execution cadence.
- Management flagged near-term adjusted operating margin pressure in Q4 due to timing mismatches between capex deployment and revenue recognition—investors should watch for sequential margin compression despite strong Q3 prints.
- Rapid diversification also means a larger portion of backlog now sits with smaller customers whose ramp profiles may be less predictable, a nuance that surfaced in investor follow-up commentary.
