# CoreWeave (CRWV) – Valuation Update
*Analysis Date: November 11, 2025*

## Executive Summary

**BLUF: CRWV’s valuation multiples compressed sharply (EV/Revenue 18.41x vs 33.30x in June, EV/EBITDA 41.93x vs 98.86x) as the stock settled near $105; backlog strength and 61% adj. EBITDA margin support the long-term story, but leverage and capex execution risks justify a disciplined upside view—base case equity value now ≈$100–$115 per share (down from $95–$125), bull case $180+, bear case $50, supporting a HOLD / REDUCE stance.**

*Data sourced from `financials/2025_11/yahoo_stats.md` and prior snapshots.*

- Shares fell ~9% post-earnings despite headline beats as investors digested the $12–14B 2025 capex reset (≈40% below prior plans), powered-shell delays, and guidance for near-term adjusted operating margin pressure—reinforcing the view that CoreWeave trades like a capital-intensive infrastructure operator rather than a pure software play.

## Comparable Company Check
| Company | Market Cap | EV/Revenue | EV/EBITDA | Revenue Growth | Gross Margin |
|---------|------------|------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| CoreWeave | $51.5B | 18.41x | 41.93x | +206.7% | 74.5% |
| NVIDIA | $2.9T | 22.10x | 48.12x | +262% | 78.3% |
| AMD | $285B | 10.95x | 31.64x | +156% | 52.1% |
| AWS (est.) | $1.9T | 8.70x | 22.90x | +17% | 60.1% |
| Microsoft Azure (est.) | $3.3T | 16.00x | 30.20x | +31% | 72.9% |

- CRWV still trades at a premium to AMD/AWS but the gap to NVIDIA narrowed materially, reflecting investors pricing execution risk alongside backlog strength.
- Premium justified by backlog mix and adj. margin, but sustained leverage caps upside multiple expansion until capex uncertainties ease.

## Scenario Analysis (Equity Value per Share)
| Scenario | Key Assumptions | EV/Revenue | EV | Equity Value | Per Share (495M diluted) |
|----------|-----------------|------------|----|--------------|--------------------------|
| Bull | Revenue growth 140% FY26, EV/Rev 24x, margins stable | 24x | ~$85B | ~$71B | ~$180 |
| Base | Revenue growth 100% FY26, EV/Rev 17x, mild margin compression | 17x | ~$66B | ~$54B | ~$110 |
| Bear | Revenue growth 60% FY26, EV/Rev 10x, margin compression | 10x | ~$35B | ~$25B | ~$50 |

- Scenario EV derived from applying multiples to FY26 revenue targets (~$3.53B TTM × growth assumptions) minus net debt (~$13.4B).
- Base case suggests limited upside from current $105–$110 levels; bull case requires on-time delivery recovery and clear financing path.
- Bear case emphasizes risk if construction delays or GPU supply issues curb backlog conversion.

## DCF Refresh (High-Level)
- Revenue trajectory: $8.5B FY25 → $14B FY26 → $22B FY27 (moderated from October).
- Margin pathway: Gross margin 74–76%, adj. EBITDA margin 55–60%, operating margin improving from 4% to 18% by FY27.
- WACC: 12% (unchanged; leverage and sector risk).
- Terminal: 12x EBITDA (lowered from 15x given leverage).
- Resulting enterprise value ~$70B; equity value ~$55B → ~$110/share (consistent with base case multiple approach).

## Key Valuation Drivers to Monitor
1. **Backlog realization:** Timing of Meta/OpenAI expansions; visibility on >1 GW unsold capacity.
2. **Capex cadence:** Confirmation of 2026 plan (>2x 2025) and financing mix (DDTL vs equity vs OEM).
3. **Leverage & interest coverage:** Adj. EBITDA vs $310.6M quarterly interest expense; potential refinancing to improve coupon.
4. **Peer multiple moves:** NVIDIA/AMD rerating amid AI GPU supply updates; relative premium may expand or compress.
5. **Equity market sentiment:** Pre-market drop to $95.50 demonstrates sensitivity to delivery headlines; watch for volatility spikes when project milestones shift.
6. **Guidance credibility:** Delivery on revised $12–14B 2025 capex timeline and clarity on Q4 margin compression will influence whether the market treats CoreWeave as disciplined infrastructure or risky growth.

## Updated Recommendation (Post-Earnings)

**Price Target:** $100–$115 (down from $95–$125; midpoint $107 vs. prior $110)  
**Rating:** HOLD / REDUCE (downgrade from Outperform)  
**Conviction:** 6.5/10 (down from 7.5/10)

### Rationale for Target Reduction
1. Capex guidance cut signals execution constraints that cap near-term backlog conversion.
2. Powered-shell delays extend visibility uncertainty and shift revenue into FY26.
3. FY26 leverage and refinancing risk now a primary valuation overhang.
4. Hyperscaler competition timeline compressed (H1 2026 vs prior H2 2026 expectation), pressuring margin assumptions.

### Risk-Reward Skew
- Upside to $130–$150: Requires flawless Q4 execution, detailed FY26 financing plan, and limited hyperscaler pricing pressure (25% probability).
- Downside to $75–$85: Powered-shell delays persist, FY26 capex underfunded, or hyperscaler pricing accelerates (30% probability).
- Most likely range $100–$110 as investors await proof-points on delivery and funding (45% probability).
