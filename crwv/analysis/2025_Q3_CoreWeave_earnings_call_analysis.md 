# CoreWeave Q3 FY2025 Earnings Call Overview

## Overall Picture

CoreWeave delivered exceptional Q3 2025 results with revenue of $1.4 billion (up 134% year-over-year) and adjusted EBITDA of $838 million with a 61% margin, while building a massive $55.6 billion revenue backlog. The company is operating in an extremely supply-constrained market where demand for AI infrastructure dramatically exceeds available capacity.

## Overall Sentiment

The tone is **highly optimistic and bullish**. Management emphasizes CoreWeave's position as "the essential cloud for AI" with unmatched technical execution. The company received SemiAnalysis's highest distinction (Platinum Cluster Max ranking) for the second time, a distinction no other cloud provider has achieved even once. However, there's underlying acknowledgment of real operational challenges.

## Key Concerns Raised

**Supply Chain Delays**: The most pressing concern is temporary delays from a third-party data center developer who is behind schedule, which impacts fourth-quarter expectations. The bottleneck is specifically at the "powered shell" level rather than power availability itself. However, the affected customer has agreed to adjust delivery schedules and extend contract expiration dates, preserving full contract value.

**Capacity Constraints**: This systemic supply chain challenge is expected to persist for the foreseeable future across the industry.

## Main Projects and Management Focus

1. **Diversification**: Customer concentration has dramatically improved—no single customer now represents more than approximately 35% of revenue backlog (down from 85% at year start), and 60% of backlog is with investment-grade customers.

2. **Data Center Expansion**: The company expanded active power to 590 MW and contracted power capacity to 2.9 GW, with over 1 GW of contracted capacity available to be sold. Eight new data centers were added across the U.S., with expansions in Europe including a major presence in Scotland in partnership with the U.K. government.

3. **Self-Build Infrastructure**: CoreWeave has embarked on self-build projects for greater operational control and supply chain resilience.

4. **Platform Expansion Through M&A**: Recent acquisitions of OpenPipe, Marimo, and Monolith are expanding CoreWeave's capabilities from developer tools to enterprise physical-world AI applications.

5. **Customer Diversification and Enterprise Growth**: The number of customers exceeding $100 million in annual revenue tripled year-over-year, with wins spanning foundation model developers (Poolside), AI natives (Jasper), enterprises (CrowdStrike, Rakuten), and public sector (NASA).

6. **Future Growth Acceleration**: 2026 CapEx is expected to be more than double 2025 levels, signaling aggressive continued expansion.
