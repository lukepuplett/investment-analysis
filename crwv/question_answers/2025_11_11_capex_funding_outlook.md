## CoreWeave Capex Funding Outlook – Q&A

**Question:** Can CoreWeave fund its AI data-center build-out from operating cash flow alone?

**BLUF:** **No—CoreWeave will rely on heavy external financing through at least FY2029.** FY26 capex needs (> $24B) dwarf the base-case adj. EBITDA profile (~$6B), leaving an ~$18B cash gap that debt or equity must bridge if CoreWeave wants to hold or grow share against hyperscalers.

### Why Internal Funding Is Unrealistic
- **Capex vs. EBITDA math:** FY26 base case calls for $10.5B revenue, $6B adj. EBITDA, and >$24B capex. Even assuming minimal working-capital drag, the business is ~$18B short of self-funding its plan.
- **Opportunity cost of slowing builds:** Matching capex to ~$6B annual cash generation would stretch the 2.9 GW build-out over 3–4 years, handing share to AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Lambda, and Crusoe.
- **Backlog commitments:** $55.6B of contracted demand requires rapid deployment; delays would invite customer defections or repricing.

### Expected Financing Path (Illustrative)
| Period | Funding Strategy | Rationale |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| 2025–2027 | Heavy debt draw (DDTLs, secured/unsecured notes) totaling $15–20B | Build capacity quickly while demand is supply-constrained |
| 2028–2029 | Transition toward steady-state (capex $8–10B vs. EBITDA $7–8B) | Cash generation begins to cover a larger share of build |
| 2030+ | Potential FCF neutrality or positive | Only if CoreWeave maintains share and capex moderates |

### Strategic Implications
- **Leverage as a strategic bet:** CoreWeave resembles an infrastructure roll-up; success depends on sustained AI compute scarcity. Execution missteps make the capital stack fragile.
- **Potential endgames:** Most plausible outcomes are (a) acquisition by a hyperscaler seeking turnkey GPU capacity (2027–2029) or (b) IPO/term financing that institutionalizes a high debt/equity ratio (similar to other infra operators).
- **Risk framing:** Investors are underwriting a leveraged race—winners justify the balance sheet via Amazon-like scale; laggards face refinancing stress or dilution.

### Monitoring Checklist
- Quarterly capex vs. revised guidance (is $24B still realistic?).
- Net debt trajectory and interest coverage (target >2.5× adj. EBITDA).
- Backlog conversion speed—watch for cancellations if builds slip.
- Competitor capacity announcements (especially hyperscalers).
