## CoreWeave 5-Year Cash Flow & Debt Projection (with 15–25% Prepayments)

**Question:** How do customer prepayments influence CoreWeave’s funding plan for its AI data center build-out through FY2029?

**BLUF:** **Upfront customer prepayments (~20% of TCV) provide helpful liquidity but do not eliminate the need for massive external financing.** Debt still peaks near $48B in FY27, leverage crests around 6.9× adj. EBITDA, and meaningful deleveraging only begins once operating cash flow exceeds capex in FY28.

### Key Assumptions
- **Deployment cadence:** Active power rises from 0.59 GW (Q3 2025) to 2.9 GW by FY27, then levels off.
- **Revenue intensity:** ~$19B per GW initially, tapering toward $15B per GW by FY28 amid hyperscaler competition.
- **Contract cash profile:** 96% of revenue tied to 2–6 year take-or-pay contracts; customers prepay 15–25% (20% avg). Deferred revenue of ~$5.5B (Q3 2025) amortizes over 18–24 months.
- **Capex roadmap:** $13B (FY25), $24B (FY26), $18B (FY27), $7B (FY28), $6.5B (FY29).
- **Margin glide path:** Gross margin falls from 73% to 70% by FY28; adj. EBITDA margin trends from 61% (FY25) to 50% (FY29).

| Interest coverage (×) | 2.1 | 4.3 | 5.3 | 6.8 | 8.5 |
| Ending deferred revenue ($B) | 6.5 | 7.0 | 6.5 | 5.5 | 4.5 |

### Why Prepayments Help but Don’t Transform the Story
- **Coverage gap remains large:** FY26 requires $24B of capex; $2.4B of prepayments only covers ~10%. The rest must come from debt or equity.
- **Growth outruns cash receipts:** Rapid additions to contracted GW require cash outlays before revenue recognition catches up, keeping free cash flow deeply negative through FY27.
- **Peak leverage barely shifts:** Debt still crests at ~$48B in FY27 (vs. ~$48–50B without prepayments); the slope of the increase is marginally flatter.

### Deferred Revenue Trajectory
- Starts at ~$5.5B (Q3 2025), climbs toward $7B as new contracts layer in, then declines toward ~$4.5B as the backlog mix normalizes and revenue is recognized.
- Lower prepay percentages on mega-deals (Meta, OpenAI) have already compressed the historic 15–25% average; a resurgence in smaller customers could lift future prepay rates.

### Scenario Notes
- **Upside (25% prepay):** FY26 prepayments hit ~$3B; peak debt improves modestly to ~$46.5B with earlier FCF inflection (FY27).
- **Downside (pricing pressure):** A 10–15% revenue miss in FY26 pushes operating CF to ~$4.7B and peak debt above $50B.
- **Bear (extended capex):** If $20B+ capex spills into FY28, peak leverage climbs and FCF breakeven slips to FY29.

### Strategic Read-Through
- **Deleveraging hinge:** FY28 remains the critical year—once operating cash plus prevailing prepayments exceed capex, CoreWeave can start repaying debt (assumes backlog converts on schedule).
- **Balance-sheet risk:** Even with strong coverage (5.3× at peak), the absolute debt load leaves little room for execution errors or pricing shocks.
- **Investor framing:** This is still a leveraged bet on sustained AI compute demand. Prepayments smooth liquidity but do not replace the need for large-scale external financing.
