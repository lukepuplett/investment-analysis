  - **Connection is third-order**: AI spend → Data centers → Power infrastructure → Cables → Cabot materials
  - **Primary business (63% of revenue)** is tire reinforcement, unrelated to AI
  - **Investment case should focus on EV battery growth and infrastructure**, not AI data center spending
  - Better positioned for: EV battery adoption (direct driver), grid infrastructure, renewable energy

### Critical Warning: Dividend Yield Trap
- **⚠️ DO NOT INVEST FOR DIVIDEND**: Current 11.84% yield is a warning sign, not an opportunity
- **Dividend exceeds earnings**: Annual dividend $5.48 is **2.8x** TTM EPS $1.96 (280% payout ratio - unsustainable)
- **Why yield is high**: Stock price collapsed 48% from highs ($88.20 → $45.67), not because dividend is great
- **Dividend cut risk**: High if downturn persists beyond 2026 or Cash Improvement Plan doesn't execute
- **Cash flow coverage**: TTM free cash flow (~$1.85B) barely covers annual dividend cost ($1.764B)
- **Investment approach**: Treat as cyclical recovery value play, NOT dividend income investment
- **Assume dividend may be cut** - don't rely on current yield in investment thesis
